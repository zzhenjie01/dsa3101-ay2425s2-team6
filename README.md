## Project Overview

## üöÄ Getting Started & Setting Up

## üåÄ Run Models

## üßä Contributing

All contributions are to be merged to main via pull request.

### Branches

- branches recommended to follow the following format: `<username>-<feature>-<subfeature>`
  - `<name>`: GitHub username or any name that is easy to identify the owner of the branch. Strictly no spaces and all letters in lowercase.
  - `<feature>`: The name of the feature that the code is meant for.
  - `<subfeature>`: Optional input. Depends on whether the main feature is being broken down into subfeatures due to its complexity.
- For example: nghockleong-loginpage-userauthentication

### Commit Messages

Be clear and concise with the intent of the commit.

### Coding guidelines

Follows general software engineering practices. Some examples of good practices are as follows:

- Clear documentation for code written
- Meaningful function and variable names
- Refactor overly complex code into smaller chunks of code
- Code should avoid being interdependent (Changing 1 code chunk does not require huge changes across other code chunks and modules)
- Adhere to official style guides for all languages to the best of your ability.
  - Python style guide: [PEP 8 - Python Style Guide](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008)
- Do not push your secrets such as API keys to GitHub; store them in a `.env` file instead.
- Do not push model checkpoint or weights files (`.pth` or `.pt`) to GitHub as you most likely won't succeed due to the large file size.
- Do not push datasets to GitHub as it may cuz the changes count to explode on GitHub.
