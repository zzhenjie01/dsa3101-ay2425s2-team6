"The ESG metric provided is GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions. According to the context, Citi has established 2030 interim targets for several loan portfolios, including Energy and Power, Auto Manufacturing, Commercial Real Estate, Steel, and Thermal Coal Mining.

Additionally, the report mentions that operational Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions are a fraction of the Scope 3 GHG emissions from the combustion of oil and gas. However, it also states that any efforts to decarbonize operations can still result in real GHG emissions reductions and climate benefits.

However, it highlights the bank's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint through client engagement, transition support, and operational improvements.","and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero.

Large investment firms,like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports.

"Based on the provided context, I can answer the ESG metric question about ""Gender Ratio"".

The ESG metric mentioned is ""Gender ratio"", which refers to the proportion of female employees in a given category.

From the provided context, we can extract the following data related to the Gender Ratio:

- Top management: Female (46.59%) and Male (53.41%)
- Junior-middle management: Female (55.36%) and Male (44.64%)
- Non-management: Female (61.64%) and Male (38.36%)

It appears that the overall Gender Ratio for non-management employees is higher than for other levels, with a larger proportion of female employees in this category.

However, it's essential to note that the context provides only partial data on the total number of employees by level, which makes it challenging to calculate an accurate average or weighted-average gender ratio across all employee categories.","have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to maximizing performance:The Credit Suisse Research Institutefoundthat “gender diversity—or the greater representation of women—in senior roles was not just ‘nice to have’ but linked to excess stock market returns and superior corporate profitability.”The Boston Consulting Group found thatdiverse management teams had 19% more revenuegenerated from innovation.According to McKinsey,companies with top-quartile performance on gender diversity within executive teams were25% more likely to have above-average profitability, and 36% higher performance in the case of ethnically diverse teams.

on global financial markets, we identified a rise in the number of female directors on corporate boards.

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander commented on their behalf, “ISS knows that diverse boards help companies perform better and they have helped build the evidence proving the case. I can only conclude that they are afraid of the increased regulation that the SEC sought to enact during the first Trump Administration. Rather than standing up for independent proxy advice, they are preemptively throwing the value of diverse governance under the bus.”Why Does Diversity on Corporate Boards Matter?There are many investors who simply believe that ensuring corporate boards with tremendous societal power represent the gender and ethnic breakdown of the communities they serve is its own intrinsic good. But most conversations have focused less on the values-based motivations often equated with ESG, and more on the financial materiality of diversity to shareholder value creation.Sticking to the traditional line of thinking that the board of directors of a company is supposed to be fully committed to maximizing shareholder value, numerous studies from pure-play financial actors over the past decade have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to

equity and inclusion policies, the evidence is clear: having a diverse team can help businesses make better, more empathetic decisions.At the top level, agrowing body of researchshows having more women on corporate boards leads to better decision-making, stronger governance and improved environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance.Yet, progress remains slow – even in New Zealand. Though we rank highly on theHuman Development Index, the countrylags behind in leadership gender equality.Women make up 50.8% of the population and hold 40.8% of parliamentary leadership roles. But they hold only 28.5% of board seats and 26.4% of executive roles in the New Zealand’s Stock Exchange (NZX) top 50 companies (the NZX50).And while businesses are encouraged to disclose gender diversity policies by the NZX, there are no mandatory quotas, leaving progress uneven.However, change is happening. Our newresearchlooked at the the percentage of female directors in NZX-listed firms between 2016 and 2022.What we found is positive. Using information from financial infrastructure and data provider LSEG’sdatabase on global financial markets, we identified a rise in the number of female directors on

over $33 Trillion in ESG products by 2026, and over 20% of global AUM by 2027 to be ESG. This report concluded, “Belying questions of whether financial and ESG performance might conflict, nine of ten asset managers surveyed believe that integrating ESG into their investment strategy will improve overall returns. What’s more, a majority of institutional investors, 60%, reported that ESG investing has already resulted in higher performance yields, compared to non-ESG equivalents.”Where Do Investors Go from Here?This announcement echoes the broader trend of companies pulling back from DEI, to the consternation of many investors who are worried about how this could impact corporate performance. Similarly, Goldman Sachs announced that they willno longer require companies to have diverse boardsat the time of IPO, and other companies like Google and Amazon have back-tracked on DEI in moves an Associated Press/Fortune.com piece characterized as“capitulating to Trump’s war on DEI.”In response to a request for comment, Goldman Sachs provided a statement from spokesperson Tony Fratto, noting, “As a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal

"Based on the provided context, the ESG metric is ""Number of Corruption Cases"". According to the context, in 2023:

- Violations:
  - Embezzlement Cases: 2
  - Malpractice Cases: 1
  - Bribery Cases: 1
  - Provision of private loans Cases: 1

The total number of corruption cases in 2023 is not explicitly stated. However, the context does mention that ""Violations"" includes various types of corruption-related incidents.

To find a more direct answer for the ESG metric ""Number of Corruption Cases"", we need to look at the item under the sub-section ""Cases"" which provides counts for each type of violation. The total number of cases mentioned in 2023, excluding fines and settlements, is as follows:

- Salary reductions Cases: - (Not provided)
- Reprimands Cases: - (Not provided)

Given the proposed cuts to CSDDD and CSRD, however, the provision would likely apply to fewer companies than originally intended.Read more:US Companies Say ESG Rules Are a Serious Barrier to EU TradeOther changes proposed by the commission include delaying CSRD reporting by a year and easing requirements around audits and climate transition plans.A spokesperson for the commission declined to comment, citing a policy of not responding to leaks.The proposal “will be a welcome development for CSRD reporters,” saidMichael Littenberg, global head ofRopes & Gray‘s ESG, CSR & Business and Human Rights compliance practice.

EU Weighs Easing Corporate Liability Under Toughest ESG LawByJohn Ainger|February 12, 2025Email ThisSubscribe to NewsletterArticle0 CommentsThe European Union is reviewing the extent to which companies can be held liable for environmental and human rights breaches in their supply chains, ahead of a package designed to remove red tape from the bloc’s ESG regulatory framework.The European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, will try to better align reporting standards across the three main pillars of its environmental, social and governance rule-set later this month. Plans to cut reporting requirements — especially for small and medium-sized companies — have been well-flagged, but officials are now also looking at ways to ease rules that require firms to clean up their value chains under theCorporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, or CSDDD.“Civil liability is one of the topics we are looking at,” said Valdis Dombrovskis, the commissioner in charge of the EU’s push to simplify regulations. We are assessing “what kind of legal certainties companies are having, how many layers up and down the value chain they should actually be monitoring and able to influence.”US Companies

At the same time, activists defending environmental and human rights causes hold the directive up as an example of what ESG rules should aspire to. As the framework currently stands, CSDDD infringements could result in fines of as much as 5% of a firm’s global revenue.Cutting red tape is one of the biggest priorities for the EU as it tries to stay competitive with the US and China. The commission is due to present its first so-called simplification omnibus on Feb. 26, in which it will address several pieces of ESG legislation at once. Besides CSDDD, the omnibus will target the EU’s Taxonomy Regulation and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.Dombrovskis said that the package would likely also include adjustments to the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.

The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero. This resulted in a carbon credit market that allowed high GHG emitting countries and businesses to purchase credits from underdeveloped countries that produce little emissions.On the financial side, a multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms,like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces.This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry.

"Based on the provided context, I couldn't find any information about the ""Board of Director gender ratio"" in the ESG report. Therefore, my answer is:

I don't know.","on global financial markets, we identified a rise in the number of female directors on corporate boards. We also saw a corresponding improvement in the firms’ ESG performance.Despite making up 50.4% of the population, women hold only 28.5% of board seats and 26.4% of executive roles in NZX50 companies.T. Schneider/ShutterstockBoosting performanceBetween 2016 and 2022, the proportion of female directors in NZX-listed firms increased from 26% to 36%. These same businesses saw an average 33% improvement in their ESG performance.Notably, governance – one of the key ESG pillars – improved significantly, with a 31% increase on average. Governance specifically refers to the effectiveness of the firm’s management systems, board structure and capacity to protect shareholder interests.While it’s not possible to say outright that having more women on the board directly influenced governance outcomes, we saw a positive relationship between the two. This suggests having more women in leadership strengthens corporate oversight and ethical decision making.Gender diversity does not have the same level of importance in all contexts. While social and environmental performance also improved, this

have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to maximizing performance:The Credit Suisse Research Institutefoundthat “gender diversity—or the greater representation of women—in senior roles was not just ‘nice to have’ but linked to excess stock market returns and superior corporate profitability.”The Boston Consulting Group found thatdiverse management teams had 19% more revenuegenerated from innovation.According to McKinsey,companies with top-quartile performance on gender diversity within executive teams were25% more likely to have above-average profitability, and 36% higher performance in the case of ethnically diverse teams. In general, McKinsey has issued four reports over the past decade noting the value of diversity, statements that have beenrecently contestedin Econ Journal Watch.This reflects the overall trend towards ESG investments for the presumption of enhanced returns. Ina 2022 survey from Price Waterhouse Coopersof over 250 asset owners reflecting just under half of global assets under management (AUM), PWC noted they expect over $33 Trillion in ESG products by 2026, and over 20% of global AUM by 2027 to be ESG. This

Though we rank highly on theHuman Development Index, the countrylags behind in leadership gender equality.Women make up 50.8% of the population and hold 40.8% of parliamentary leadership roles. But they hold only 28.5% of board seats and 26.4% of executive roles in the New Zealand’s Stock Exchange (NZX) top 50 companies (the NZX50).And while businesses are encouraged to disclose gender diversity policies by the NZX, there are no mandatory quotas, leaving progress uneven.However, change is happening. Our newresearchlooked at the the percentage of female directors in NZX-listed firms between 2016 and 2022.What we found is positive. Using information from financial infrastructure and data provider LSEG’sdatabase on global financial markets, we identified a rise in the number of female directors on

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander commented on their behalf, “ISS knows that diverse boards help companies perform better and they have helped build the evidence proving the case. I can only conclude that they are afraid of the increased regulation that the SEC sought to enact during the first Trump Administration. Rather than standing up for independent proxy advice, they are preemptively throwing the value of diverse governance under the bus.”Why Does Diversity on Corporate Boards Matter?There are many investors who simply believe that ensuring corporate boards with tremendous societal power represent the gender and ethnic breakdown of the communities they serve is its own intrinsic good. But most conversations have focused less on the values-based motivations often equated with ESG, and more on the financial materiality of diversity to shareholder value creation.Sticking to the traditional line of thinking that the board of directors of a company is supposed to be fully committed to maximizing shareholder value, numerous studies from pure-play financial actors over the past decade have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to

The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero.

Large investment firms,like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports.

"Based on the ESG metric ""Water consumption"", I can answer as follows:

The Bank reported a significant reduction in water consumption through various initiatives, including tracking water usage and implementing measures to reduce waste and improve water efficiency. In 2023, the Bank used 19,274 m3 of recycled water to replace natural water for activities such as watering trees and lawns at its Krungthai Training Center.

Additionally, the Bank has implemented guidelines for reducing water consumption, including running faucets only when needed and promptly turning them off when not in use. The organization also regularly inspects its water supply system for any leaks and provides communication materials to promote efficient water use among employees.

It appears that the Bank is actively working on reducing its water consumption, but I don't have information on specific targets or metrics for reduction.","into every RFP moving forward. Often we’ll be able to divert waste in creative and less-expensive ways–like recycling bathroom fixtures or donating furniture to local nonprofit organizations. Or, if a project’s waste management plan adds to the total cost, we’ll be able to plan ahead for proper reuse and recycling.Through simple operational adjustments like installing low-flow shower heads and LED light bulbs, we’ve achieved measurable sustainability gains with little to no green premium. We’ve implemented smart technology to automate and streamline temperature control at several hotels, worked to eliminate single-use plastics, and we now only offer reef-safe sunscreen at all Highgate’s Hawaii and Key West properties. At the Westin Las Vegas and other full-service properties, the installation of water bottle refill stations has reduced plastic consumption and increased socialization in the lobby.While scaling back might feel disappointing, we know that impact doesn’t always need to come from grand gestures.

"Based on the ESG report, I can provide an answer to the question about the turnover rate.

According to the context, the ""Employee turnover rate"" is mentioned as a percentage of employees who have left the organization, voluntarily or involuntarily, in the last 12 months. It is calculated based on the number of employees who have left and the average number of employees in the last 12 months.

The ESG metric provided is ""Turnover rate"". However, the context actually reports the ""Employee turnover rate"", which is a related but distinct metric. The Employee turnover rate is the percentage of employees who have left the organization in the last 12 months.

Therefore, I can answer that: 

The average employee turnover rate across all regions and years reported in the context is:

- Global: 19% (17% in 2022, 21% in 2023)
- Brazil: 20%

"The ESG metric provided is the ""Board of Director gender ratio"", which refers to the proportion of female directors on the board.

According to the context, Woori Financial Group has achieved a Board of Director gender ratio of over 40% since 2023. The current ratio as of March 2024 is 45.0%. This indicates an increase in the number of female independent directors compared to previous years.

In 2022, the women's ratio was 30.5%, which increased by 14.5 percentage points (p.p.) compared to the previous year.

Therefore, the answer is: The Board of Director gender ratio has improved over time, with a significant increase in recent years.","on global financial markets, we identified a rise in the number of female directors on corporate boards. We also saw a corresponding improvement in the firms’ ESG performance.Despite making up 50.4% of the population, women hold only 28.5% of board seats and 26.4% of executive roles in NZX50 companies.T. Schneider/ShutterstockBoosting performanceBetween 2016 and 2022, the proportion of female directors in NZX-listed firms increased from 26% to 36%. These same businesses saw an average 33% improvement in their ESG performance.Notably, governance – one of the key ESG pillars – improved significantly, with a 31% increase on average. Governance specifically refers to the effectiveness of the firm’s management systems, board structure and capacity to protect shareholder interests.While it’s not possible to say outright that having more women on the board directly influenced governance outcomes, we saw a positive relationship between the two. This suggests having more women in leadership strengthens corporate oversight and ethical decision making.Gender diversity does not have the same level of importance in all contexts. While social and environmental performance also improved, this

have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to maximizing performance:The Credit Suisse Research Institutefoundthat “gender diversity—or the greater representation of women—in senior roles was not just ‘nice to have’ but linked to excess stock market returns and superior corporate profitability.”The Boston Consulting Group found thatdiverse management teams had 19% more revenuegenerated from innovation.According to McKinsey,companies with top-quartile performance on gender diversity within executive teams were25% more likely to have above-average profitability, and 36% higher performance in the case of ethnically diverse teams. In general, McKinsey has issued four reports over the past decade noting the value of diversity, statements that have beenrecently contestedin Econ Journal Watch.This reflects the overall trend towards ESG investments for the presumption of enhanced returns. Ina 2022 survey from Price Waterhouse Coopersof over 250 asset owners reflecting just under half of global assets under management (AUM), PWC noted they expect over $33 Trillion in ESG products by 2026, and over 20% of global AUM by 2027 to be ESG. This

Though we rank highly on theHuman Development Index, the countrylags behind in leadership gender equality.Women make up 50.8% of the population and hold 40.8% of parliamentary leadership roles. But they hold only 28.5% of board seats and 26.4% of executive roles in the New Zealand’s Stock Exchange (NZX) top 50 companies (the NZX50).And while businesses are encouraged to disclose gender diversity policies by the NZX, there are no mandatory quotas, leaving progress uneven.However, change is happening. Our newresearchlooked at the the percentage of female directors in NZX-listed firms between 2016 and 2022.What we found is positive. Using information from financial infrastructure and data provider LSEG’sdatabase on global financial markets, we identified a rise in the number of female directors on

For example, around 80% of flight attendants are women. But only 8% are pilots, even with a significant increase in pushes to recruit more female pilots.Delta’s and United’s most recent ESG reports from 2023 say that women make up around 34% and 33% of senior roles, respectively.American, Delta, United and JetBlue also signed onto theInternational Air Transport Association’s “25 by 2025,”a pledge to increase female representation among corporate and frontline roles.DEI policies in corporate America took off in 2020 following the George Floyd protests.

on global financial markets, we identified a rise in the number of female directors on corporate boards.

"The ESG metric you provided is ""Electricity consumption"" which is not directly present in the context. However, it can be inferred from the information about ""Scope 2 Electricity Dual Reporting"", ""Carbon dioxide equivalent"" and other related terms.

To answer your question based on the given context:

- The total electricity consumption (before uplift and scale up) is not explicitly provided in the context.
- However, the location-based totals for each region are provided:
    - Argentina: 4,958 tonnes CO2e
    - Bahrain: 1,131 tonnes CO2e

    - India: 30,239 tonnes CO2e
    - Malta: 1,390 tonnes CO2e
    - Mexico: 43,941 tonnes CO2e
    - Middle East and Türkiye (excluding Bahrain): 15,808 tonnes CO2e
    - North America: 22,070 tonnes CO2e
    - Rest Asia Pacific: 49,271 tonnes CO2e
    - Switzerland: 83 tonnes CO2e
    - United Kingdom: 39,034 tonnes CO2e

These values can be used to infer the total electricity consumption by adding them up:
265,357 (Group total Scope 2 before uplift and scale up) + 307,023 (Group total Scope 2 after uplift and scale up) = 572,380 tonnes of CO2 equivalent

However, this is not the same as the total electricity consumption. To find that, we would need to apply the uplift and scale-up factors:

"The ESG metric provided is ""Gender ratio"". Based on the context, I can evaluate the answer as follows:

The Bank's average compensation ratio between female and male employees for different levels of employment shows a trend of decreasing ratios as you move down the organizational hierarchy. The ratios are:

- Executive level: 0.87 (management level) to 0.92 (executive level)
- Management level: 0.94
- Non-management level: 1.24

The highest ratio is found among non-management employees, indicating a significant gap in compensation between male and female employees.

It appears that the Bank has room for improvement in reducing this pay gap, as most of the ratios are not equal to 1, which would indicate perfect equality.","have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to maximizing performance:The Credit Suisse Research Institutefoundthat “gender diversity—or the greater representation of women—in senior roles was not just ‘nice to have’ but linked to excess stock market returns and superior corporate profitability.”The Boston Consulting Group found thatdiverse management teams had 19% more revenuegenerated from innovation.According to McKinsey,companies with top-quartile performance on gender diversity within executive teams were25% more likely to have above-average profitability, and 36% higher performance in the case of ethnically diverse teams.

on global financial markets, we identified a rise in the number of female directors on corporate boards.

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander commented on their behalf, “ISS knows that diverse boards help companies perform better and they have helped build the evidence proving the case. I can only conclude that they are afraid of the increased regulation that the SEC sought to enact during the first Trump Administration. Rather than standing up for independent proxy advice, they are preemptively throwing the value of diverse governance under the bus.”Why Does Diversity on Corporate Boards Matter?There are many investors who simply believe that ensuring corporate boards with tremendous societal power represent the gender and ethnic breakdown of the communities they serve is its own intrinsic good. But most conversations have focused less on the values-based motivations often equated with ESG, and more on the financial materiality of diversity to shareholder value creation.Sticking to the traditional line of thinking that the board of directors of a company is supposed to be fully committed to maximizing shareholder value, numerous studies from pure-play financial actors over the past decade have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to

and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero. This resulted in a carbon credit market that allowed high GHG emitting countries and businesses to purchase credits from underdeveloped countries that produce little emissions.On the financial side, a multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms,like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces.This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry.

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander commented on their behalf, “ISS knows that diverse boards help companies perform better and they have helped build the evidence proving the case.

Rather than standing up for independent proxy advice, they are preemptively throwing the value of diverse governance under the bus.”Why Does Diversity on Corporate Boards Matter?There are many investors who simply believe that ensuring corporate boards with tremendous societal power represent the gender and ethnic breakdown of the communities they serve is its own intrinsic good. But most conversations have focused less on the values-based motivations often equated with ESG, and more on the financial materiality of diversity to shareholder value creation.Sticking to the traditional line of thinking that the board of directors of a company is supposed to be fully committed to maximizing shareholder value, numerous studies from pure-play financial actors over the past decade have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to

According to the context, the Bank has set a target to reduce GHG emissions by at least 30% by 2030 compared to the base year of 2022. This indicates that the Bank's goal is to decrease its overall greenhouse gas emissions over time.

Additionally, it is mentioned that the Bank has already implemented some initiatives to reduce GHG emissions, such as:

* Transitioning standard centrally used vehicles from conventional to electric
* Installing EV charging stations and related equipment
* Reducing fuel consumption by 9,000 kWh per year (resulting in a decrease of 4.94 tCO2e in greenhouse gas emissions per year)

It is also mentioned that the Bank aims to replace 100% of its pool vehicles with electric vehicles by 2030.

For the ESG metric of ""Water Consumption"", here's my evaluation:

* The Bank has taken actions to improve water usage efficiency in its office buildings and branches' surrounding areas.
* In 2023, the Bank established guidelines for reducing water consumption and implemented initiatives to enhance water use efficiency.
* A specific example is provided at Krungthai Training Center, where advanced wastewater treatment technology and a water recycling system were used to improve treated wastewater quality and reuse it for activities such as watering trees and lawns (19,274 m3 of recycled water in 2023).
* The Bank has also improved its waste management efforts by participating in the Low Emission Support Scheme (LESS) arranged by the Greenhouse Gas Management Organization.
* The Bank has established a comprehensive system for collecting and tracking data for each type of waste, including water-related waste.

However, I don't have information on specific water consumption targets or reductions achieved by the Bank.

and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero. This resulted in a carbon credit market that allowed high GHG emitting countries and businesses to purchase credits from underdeveloped countries that produce little emissions.On the financial side, a multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms,like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces.This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has proposed measures to strengthen and provide clarity on the framework for ESG Rating Providers (ERP) to withdraw ratings and disclose the rating rationale.Conditions for ERPsThe market regulator has laid down conditions for ERPs to withdraw ratings under the two types of revenue models: subscriber-pays and issuer-pays models. Last year, the regulator had mandated environment, social and governance (ESG) rating providers to register and obtain an ERP license.In the subscriber-pays model, ERPs can withdraw a rating if there are no subscribers for the rating. In case the rated entity or instrument is part of a subscriber’s rating package, such as the Nifty 50 index, the rating may not be withdrawn. Once the rating is withdrawn, it has to be withdrawn for all subscribers, SEBI clarified.ERPs with the issuer-pays model can only withdraw a rating after continuously three years of rating the security, or half way through the security’s tenure—whichever is higher. However, this is subject to receiving approval from 75 per cent of the bondholders by value.Further, SEBI has proposed that ERPs following a subscriber-pays model should share

Governance specifically refers to the effectiveness of the firm’s management systems, board structure and capacity to protect shareholder interests.While it’s not possible to say outright that having more women on the board directly influenced governance outcomes, we saw a positive relationship between the two. This suggests having more women in leadership strengthens corporate oversight and ethical decision making.Gender diversity does not have the same level of importance in all contexts.

have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to maximizing performance:The Credit Suisse Research Institutefoundthat “gender diversity—or the greater representation of women—in senior roles was not just ‘nice to have’ but linked to excess stock market returns and superior corporate profitability.”The Boston Consulting Group found thatdiverse management teams had 19% more revenuegenerated from innovation.According to McKinsey,companies with top-quartile performance on gender diversity within executive teams were25% more likely to have above-average profitability, and 36% higher performance in the case of ethnically diverse teams. In general, McKinsey has issued four reports over the past decade noting the value of diversity, statements that have beenrecently contestedin Econ Journal Watch.This reflects the overall trend towards ESG investments for the presumption of enhanced returns.

Globally, issues such as land availability, regulatory hurdles and long-term project management can hinder progress. For example, balancing land use for agriculture, housing and forestry requires careful planning.Businesses can navigate these challenges by collaborating with forestry experts, engaging local communities and adopting innovative land-use strategies. Leveraging technology, such as satellite monitoring and data analytics, can also improve project management and transparency.How To Get Started• Assess your carbon footprint:Begin by identifying the volume of emissions that need to be offset and focus on reducing emissions wherever possible. Companies can determine their carbon footprint through carbon accounting tools such as the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, corporate sustainability reports or third-party assessments. Common ways to reduce emissions include optimizing energy efficiency, switching to renewable energy sources and reducing waste in supply chains.• Partner

Performance, was assessed using data from Statista’s financial database and targeted research. The companies had to meet certain criteria to be considered for the evaluation, including generating a revenue of at least US $100 million in 2023. Companies also needed to either demonstrate positive revenue growth from 2021 to 2023 or generate a profit in 2023. Both relative and absolute financial performance were considered in the evaluation.The third dimension, Sustainability Transparency, was evaluated based on ESG data from 2022 among standardized KPIs from Statista’s ESG Database and targeted data research. To formulate a comprehensive ESG index, multiple data points were collected. For the environmental evaluation, this included the carbon emissions intensity and reduction rate, as well as the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) rating. The social dimension assessed the share of women on the board of directors and the existence of a human rights policy. The governance dimension evaluated whether a company had a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report adhering to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and a compliance or anti-corruption guideline.

and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero. This resulted in a carbon credit market that allowed high GHG emitting countries and businesses to purchase credits from underdeveloped countries that produce little emissions.On the financial side, a multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms,like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces.This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry. Funds that claim to be ESG, green, climate friendly, or sustainable must back up those claims with data. As a result of demand and Paris Agreement based

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander commented on their behalf, “ISS knows that diverse boards help companies perform better and they have helped build the evidence proving the case. I can only conclude that they are afraid of the increased regulation that the SEC sought to enact during the first Trump Administration. Rather than standing up for independent proxy advice, they are preemptively throwing the value of diverse governance under the bus.”Why Does Diversity on Corporate Boards Matter?There are many investors who simply believe that ensuring corporate boards with tremendous societal power represent the gender and ethnic breakdown of the communities they serve is its own intrinsic good. But most conversations have focused less on the values-based motivations often equated with ESG, and more on the financial materiality of diversity to shareholder value creation.Sticking to the traditional line of thinking that the board of directors of a company is supposed to be fully committed to maximizing shareholder value, numerous studies from pure-play financial actors over the past decade have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to

"According to the provided context from Citi's 2022 ESG Report, on Page 26, here is the answer to the question regarding the ESG metric ""GHG emissions"":

1. GHG (Greenhouse Gas) Emissions are mentioned as a key data element used by both climate risk and net zero workstreams.
2. Both rely on common data elements such as GHG emissions and a better understanding of clients' climate change mitigation and/or adaptation plans.
3. The report mentions that reducing operational Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions is considered to be real emissions reductions and climate benefits for some clients, even if they are less impactful compared to Scope 3 emissions from the combustion of oil and gas.

Therefore, based on the ESG metric ""GHG emissions"" in Citi's 2022 ESG Report:

The answer is that Citi focuses on reducing its operational GHG emissions (Scope 1 & 2) as well as investing in client decarbonization efforts to reduce Scope 3 emissions.","and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero. This resulted in a carbon credit market that allowed high GHG emitting countries and businesses to purchase credits from underdeveloped countries that produce little emissions.On the financial side, a multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms,like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces.This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry. Funds that claim to be ESG, green, climate friendly, or sustainable must back up those claims with data. As a result of demand and Paris Agreement based

"The ESG metric provided is ""Gender Ratio"". Based on the context, I can tell you that the gender ratio is not explicitly stated as a single number. However, the report provides some data related to this metric.

According to the report, there are three groups of employees mentioned with their respective gender ratios:

1. Executive level: The executive-level female-to-male ratio is 0.87 (male) and 0.92 (female), indicating that on average, females earn approximately 7% less than males in this category.
2. Management level: The management-level female-to-male ratio is 0.94 (male) and 0.92 (female), indicating a very similar difference.
3. Non-management level: The non-management-level female-to-male ratio is 1.24 (male) and 1, which is significantly higher than the other two categories.

It's worth noting that these ratios are based on base salaries only or base salaries plus other cash incentives. There isn't a single number provided for the overall gender ratio of all employees, so I don't know this specific metric's value in numbers.","have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to maximizing performance:The Credit Suisse Research Institutefoundthat “gender diversity—or the greater representation of women—in senior roles was not just ‘nice to have’ but linked to excess stock market returns and superior corporate profitability.”The Boston Consulting Group found thatdiverse management teams had 19% more revenuegenerated from innovation.According to McKinsey,companies with top-quartile performance on gender diversity within executive teams were25% more likely to have above-average profitability, and 36% higher performance in the case of ethnically diverse teams.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has proposed measures to strengthen and provide clarity on the framework for ESG Rating Providers (ERP) to withdraw ratings and disclose the rating rationale.Conditions for ERPsThe market regulator has laid down conditions for ERPs to withdraw ratings under the two types of revenue models: subscriber-pays and issuer-pays models. Last year, the regulator had mandated environment, social and governance (ESG) rating providers to register and obtain an ERP license.In the subscriber-pays model, ERPs can withdraw a rating if there are no subscribers for the rating. In case the rated entity or instrument is part of a subscriber’s rating package, such as the Nifty 50 index, the rating may not be withdrawn. Once the rating is withdrawn, it has to be withdrawn for all subscribers, SEBI clarified.ERPs with the issuer-pays model can only withdraw a rating after continuously three years of rating the security, or half way through the security’s tenure—whichever is higher. However, this is subject to receiving approval from 75 per cent of the bondholders by value.Further, SEBI has proposed that ERPs following a subscriber-pays model should share

That’s down from 6,328,510 CO2 e tons the previous season. The majority of the club’s Scope 1 emissions come from methane, while its Scope 2 emissions stem from district heating.The club is yet to measure its Scope 3 emissions, although Bodino says they will be doing that for the first time this season, in line with the EU’s CSRD regulation. Juventus had prepared to measure Scope 3 emissions several years ago, but those plans were delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic.For Bodino, getting the baseline emissions is “huge.” She expects a substantial spike in the club’s emissions numbers, noting that their partners at the University of Sant’Anna tell them 70% of emissions come from fan mobility. After establishing the club’s baseline Scope 3 emissions, Bodino will look at defined KPIs to reduce the club’s emissions over the coming seasons. Juventus will use fan surveys to assess how fans move to and from matches.Moving ForwardDespite Juventus’s decade-plus work on

"The ESG metric mentioned is ""Gender ratio."" According to the context, Woori Financial Group has made efforts to improve gender diversity on its board by:

* Maintaining a ratio of over 40% female independent directors among the pool of candidates since 2023.
* Newly appointing two female independent directors in 2024, expanding the diversity in terms of gender and areas of expertise within the board.

The current gender ratio is 45.0%, which is an increase of 14.5% compared to 2022 (30.5%).","have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to maximizing performance:The Credit Suisse Research Institutefoundthat “gender diversity—or the greater representation of women—in senior roles was not just ‘nice to have’ but linked to excess stock market returns and superior corporate profitability.”The Boston Consulting Group found thatdiverse management teams had 19% more revenuegenerated from innovation.According to McKinsey,companies with top-quartile performance on gender diversity within executive teams were25% more likely to have above-average profitability, and 36% higher performance in the case of ethnically diverse teams. In general, McKinsey has issued four reports over the past decade noting the value of diversity, statements that have beenrecently contestedin Econ Journal Watch.This reflects the overall trend towards ESG investments for the presumption of enhanced returns. Ina 2022 survey from Price Waterhouse Coopersof over 250 asset owners reflecting just under half of global assets under management (AUM), PWC noted they expect over $33 Trillion in ESG products by 2026, and over 20% of global AUM by 2027 to be ESG.

on global financial markets, we identified a rise in the number of female directors on corporate boards.

Schneider/ShutterstockBoosting performanceBetween 2016 and 2022, the proportion of female directors in NZX-listed firms increased from 26% to 36%. These same businesses saw an average 33% improvement in their ESG performance.Notably, governance – one of the key ESG pillars – improved significantly, with a 31% increase on average. Governance specifically refers to the effectiveness of the firm’s management systems, board structure and capacity to protect shareholder interests.While it’s not possible to say outright that having more women on the board directly influenced governance outcomes, we saw a positive relationship between the two. This suggests having more women in leadership strengthens corporate oversight and ethical decision making.Gender diversity does not have the same level of importance in all contexts. While social and environmental performance also improved, this

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander commented on their behalf, “ISS knows that diverse boards help companies perform better and they have helped build the evidence proving the case. I can only conclude that they are afraid of the increased regulation that the SEC sought to enact during the first Trump Administration. Rather than standing up for independent proxy advice, they are preemptively throwing the value of diverse governance under the bus.”Why Does Diversity on Corporate Boards Matter?There are many investors who simply believe that ensuring corporate boards with tremendous societal power represent the gender and ethnic breakdown of the communities they serve is its own intrinsic good. But most conversations have focused less on the values-based motivations often equated with ESG, and more on the financial materiality of diversity to shareholder value creation.Sticking to the traditional line of thinking that the board of directors of a company is supposed to be fully committed to maximizing shareholder value, numerous studies from pure-play financial actors over the past decade have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to

The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero. This resulted in a carbon credit market that allowed high GHG emitting countries and businesses to purchase credits from underdeveloped countries that produce little emissions.On the financial side, a multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms,like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports.

For instance, a Paris-based fund manager now requires office buildings to have flood-resistant basements housing critical MEP systems, in order to be considered core assets. Norges, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, will divest from high emission industries entirely to align with net-zero targets. CRREM analysis is becoming more commonly required for European funds, with stranded assets raising red flags.These trends across sectors and regions

and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero. This resulted in a carbon credit market that allowed high GHG emitting countries and businesses to purchase credits from underdeveloped countries that produce little emissions.On the financial side, a multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms,like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces.This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry. Funds that claim to be ESG, green, climate friendly, or sustainable must back up those claims with data. As a result of demand and Paris Agreement based

"Based on the provided context, I can evaluate the ESG metric ""Gender Ratio"" as follows:

The GRI 405-2 metric, ""Average compensation ratio between female and male employees"", measures the disparity in compensation between men and women. According to the report:

* Executive level (base salary only): Ratio 0.92
* Executive level (base salary + other cash incentives): Ratio 0.87
* Management level (base salary only): Ratio 0.92
* Management level (base salary + other cash incentives): Ratio 0.94
* Non-management level (base salary only): Ratio 1.24

These ratios indicate that, on average, women receive slightly lower compensation than men across different levels and categories.

However, there is also a GRI 405-1 metric, ""By level"", which provides the number of male and female employees in each category:

* Top management: Male 133 (53.41%), Female 116 (46.59%)
* Junior-middle management: Male 2,279 (44.64%), Female 2,826 (55.36%)
* Non-management: Male 9,507 (38.36%), Female 15,274 (61.64%)

These figures suggest that while there is a slight bias in favor of men at the top and junior-middle management levels, women are more prevalent in non-management positions.

It's worth noting that the report mentions that the Bank started collecting average compensation ratio between female and male employees' data in 2023, which might indicate an effort to address gender pay gaps.","have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to maximizing performance:The Credit Suisse Research Institutefoundthat “gender diversity—or the greater representation of women—in senior roles was not just ‘nice to have’ but linked to excess stock market returns and superior corporate profitability.”The Boston Consulting Group found thatdiverse management teams had 19% more revenuegenerated from innovation.According to McKinsey,companies with top-quartile performance on gender diversity within executive teams were25% more likely to have above-average profitability, and 36% higher performance in the case of ethnically diverse teams.

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander commented on their behalf, “ISS knows that diverse boards help companies perform better and they have helped build the evidence proving the case. I can only conclude that they are afraid of the increased regulation that the SEC sought to enact during the first Trump Administration. Rather than standing up for independent proxy advice, they are preemptively throwing the value of diverse governance under the bus.”Why Does Diversity on Corporate Boards Matter?There are many investors who simply believe that ensuring corporate boards with tremendous societal power represent the gender and ethnic breakdown of the communities they serve is its own intrinsic good. But most conversations have focused less on the values-based motivations often equated with ESG, and more on the financial materiality of diversity to shareholder value creation.Sticking to the traditional line of thinking that the board of directors of a company is supposed to be fully committed to maximizing shareholder value, numerous studies from pure-play financial actors over the past decade have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to

Companies in the second and third waves can defer compliance for an additional two years, with the aim of providing them more time to prepare.So what do these changes mean for U.S. companies?Mid-sized U.S. companies with EU subsidiaries that were previously in scope may no longer have to prepare CSRD disclosures. However, it’s important to note that large U.S. companies are still required to comply with these regulations.If your company was gearing up for CSRD reporting in 2026-2027, you might find you have additional time to streamline your ESG data collection and enhance your ESG strategies.Moreover, even if your U.S. company is not directly obligated to comply with the CSRD, you may encounter pressure from EU clients and partners due to supply chain due diligence practices.Conducting A Gap AnalysisFor U.S. companies, preparing for the

According to anew analysisfrom Ideagen Audit Analytics,the number of U.S. public companies with accounting errors so serious that they needed to withdraw their financial statementsreached a nine-year highlast year. All told, some 140 U.S. public companies had to withdraw and reissue their financials due to serious errors that were caught after the fact. The findings underscore some serious challenges confronting corporate finance departments as we make our way through 2025.While much of thenews coverageof this phenomenon has focused onfailings in the audit function, the deeper issue is the increasingly complex web of intertwined details multinational companies are now managing across their tax, finance, legal and risk

Performance, was assessed using data from Statista’s financial database and targeted research. The companies had to meet certain criteria to be considered for the evaluation, including generating a revenue of at least US $100 million in 2023. Companies also needed to either demonstrate positive revenue growth from 2021 to 2023 or generate a profit in 2023. Both relative and absolute financial performance were considered in the evaluation.The third dimension, Sustainability Transparency, was evaluated based on ESG data from 2022 among standardized KPIs from Statista’s ESG Database and targeted data research. To formulate a comprehensive ESG index, multiple data points were collected. For the environmental evaluation, this included the carbon emissions intensity and reduction rate, as well as the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) rating. The social dimension assessed the share of women on the board of directors and the existence of a human rights policy. The governance dimension evaluated whether a company had a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report adhering to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and a compliance or anti-corruption guideline. Additional

85% of the companies originally targeted in CSRD, and would be in line with German and French demands.Meanwhile, a provision for so-called double materiality — a concept that requires companies to take into account not just the financial ESG risks they may face but also their environmental and social impact — looks to be intact, according to draft material seen by Bloomberg. Given the proposed cuts to CSDDD and CSRD, however, the provision would likely apply to fewer companies than originally intended.Read more:US Companies Say ESG Rules Are a Serious Barrier to EU TradeOther changes proposed by the commission include delaying CSRD reporting by a year and easing requirements around audits and climate transition plans.A spokesperson for the commission declined to comment, citing a policy of not responding to leaks.The proposal “will be a welcome development for CSRD reporters,” saidMichael Littenberg, global head ofRopes & Gray‘s ESG, CSR & Business and Human Rights compliance practice.

have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to maximizing performance:The Credit Suisse Research Institutefoundthat “gender diversity—or the greater representation of women—in senior roles was not just ‘nice to have’ but linked to excess stock market returns and superior corporate profitability.”The Boston Consulting Group found thatdiverse management teams had 19% more revenuegenerated from innovation.According to McKinsey,companies with top-quartile performance on gender diversity within executive teams were25% more likely to have above-average profitability, and 36% higher performance in the case of ethnically diverse teams. In general, McKinsey has issued four reports over the past decade noting the value of diversity, statements that have beenrecently contestedin Econ Journal Watch.This reflects the overall trend towards ESG investments for the presumption of enhanced returns. Ina 2022 survey from Price Waterhouse Coopersof over 250 asset owners reflecting just under half of global assets under management (AUM), PWC noted they expect over $33 Trillion in ESG products by 2026, and over 20% of global AUM by 2027 to be ESG.

Though we rank highly on theHuman Development Index, the countrylags behind in leadership gender equality.Women make up 50.8% of the population and hold 40.8% of parliamentary leadership roles. But they hold only 28.5% of board seats and 26.4% of executive roles in the New Zealand’s Stock Exchange (NZX) top 50 companies (the NZX50).And while businesses are encouraged to disclose gender diversity policies by the NZX, there are no mandatory quotas, leaving progress uneven.However, change is happening. Our newresearchlooked at the the percentage of female directors in NZX-listed firms between 2016 and 2022.What we found is positive. Using information from financial infrastructure and data provider LSEG’sdatabase on global financial markets, we identified a rise in the number of female directors on

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander commented on their behalf, “ISS knows that diverse boards help companies perform better and they have helped build the evidence proving the case. I can only conclude that they are afraid of the increased regulation that the SEC sought to enact during the first Trump Administration. Rather than standing up for independent proxy advice, they are preemptively throwing the value of diverse governance under the bus.”Why Does Diversity on Corporate Boards Matter?There are many investors who simply believe that ensuring corporate boards with tremendous societal power represent the gender and ethnic breakdown of the communities they serve is its own intrinsic good. But most conversations have focused less on the values-based motivations often equated with ESG, and more on the financial materiality of diversity to shareholder value creation.Sticking to the traditional line of thinking that the board of directors of a company is supposed to be fully committed to maximizing shareholder value, numerous studies from pure-play financial actors over the past decade have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to

MoneyColorado Bill Could Require Businesses To Disclose Climate EmissionsByJon McGowan, Contributor.I am an attorney who writes about ESG policy, laws, and regulations.Follow AuthorFeb 17, 2025, 06:44pm ESTSave ArticleCommentDenver, Colorado USA:Gold plated roof top of the Capitol Building of Denver ColoradogettyColorado has joined the wave of states considering requiring businesses to disclose greenhouse gas emissions. This follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announcing it will eliminate the reporting requirement that was adopted in 2024, but never went into effect. If passed, businesses with a presence in Colorado and over $1 billion in revenue will be required to start reporting as soon as 2028.Following the Paris Agreement in 2015, a series of global initiatives were pursued to reduce the impacts of climate change and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050.A multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms,like BlackRock, used their influence to drive sustainability and environmental, social, and governance. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability

and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero. This resulted in a carbon credit market that allowed high GHG emitting countries and businesses to purchase credits from underdeveloped countries that produce little emissions.On the financial side, a multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms,like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces.This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry. Funds that claim to be ESG, green, climate friendly, or sustainable must back up those claims with data. As a result of demand and Paris Agreement based

MCI has made it clear that it sees a business opportunity in building sustainability strategies for clients, not in basic measurement.The company’s voluntary adherence to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards in its most recent financial and sustainability report helps build trust with public companies that must meet similar standards in their own sustainability reporting.Its annual report showed that revenue increased 6% in 2023 to $515 million (€493.1 million) in 2023 and EBITDA from operations rose 29% to $31.9

That’s down from 6,328,510 CO2 e tons the previous season. The majority of the club’s Scope 1 emissions come from methane, while its Scope 2 emissions stem from district heating.The club is yet to measure its Scope 3 emissions, although Bodino says they will be doing that for the first time this season, in line with the EU’s CSRD regulation. Juventus had prepared to measure Scope 3 emissions several years ago, but those plans were delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic.For Bodino, getting the baseline emissions is “huge.” She expects a substantial spike in the club’s emissions numbers, noting that their partners at the University of Sant’Anna tell them 70% of emissions come from fan mobility. After establishing the club’s baseline Scope 3 emissions, Bodino will look at defined KPIs to reduce the club’s emissions over the coming seasons.

"The ESG metric mentioned is ""Board of Director gender ratio"". 

According to the context provided, Woori Financial Group has made efforts to strengthen the diversity of its Board of Directors by actively considering factors such as gender during the appointment process. As of 2023, they have maintained a ratio of over 40% female independent directors among the pool of candidates, and in 2024, they newly appointed two more female independent directors.

Therefore, based on the ESG metric provided, I can conclude that Woori Financial Group has made progress in increasing their Board of Director gender ratio.","on global financial markets, we identified a rise in the number of female directors on corporate boards. We also saw a corresponding improvement in the firms’ ESG performance.Despite making up 50.4% of the population, women hold only 28.5% of board seats and 26.4% of executive roles in NZX50 companies.T. Schneider/ShutterstockBoosting performanceBetween 2016 and 2022, the proportion of female directors in NZX-listed firms increased from 26% to 36%. These same businesses saw an average 33% improvement in their ESG performance.Notably, governance – one of the key ESG pillars – improved significantly, with a 31% increase on average. Governance specifically refers to the effectiveness of the firm’s management systems, board structure and capacity to protect shareholder interests.While it’s not possible to say outright that having more women on the board directly influenced governance outcomes, we saw a positive relationship between the two. This suggests having more women in leadership strengthens corporate oversight and ethical decision making.Gender diversity does not have the same level of importance in all contexts. While social and environmental performance also improved, this

have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to maximizing performance:The Credit Suisse Research Institutefoundthat “gender diversity—or the greater representation of women—in senior roles was not just ‘nice to have’ but linked to excess stock market returns and superior corporate profitability.”The Boston Consulting Group found thatdiverse management teams had 19% more revenuegenerated from innovation.According to McKinsey,companies with top-quartile performance on gender diversity within executive teams were25% more likely to have above-average profitability, and 36% higher performance in the case of ethnically diverse teams. In general, McKinsey has issued four reports over the past decade noting the value of diversity, statements that have beenrecently contestedin Econ Journal Watch.This reflects the overall trend towards ESG investments for the presumption of enhanced returns. Ina 2022 survey from Price Waterhouse Coopersof over 250 asset owners reflecting just under half of global assets under management (AUM), PWC noted they expect over $33 Trillion in ESG products by 2026, and over 20% of global AUM by 2027 to be ESG. This

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander commented on their behalf, “ISS knows that diverse boards help companies perform better and they have helped build the evidence proving the case. I can only conclude that they are afraid of the increased regulation that the SEC sought to enact during the first Trump Administration. Rather than standing up for independent proxy advice, they are preemptively throwing the value of diverse governance under the bus.”Why Does Diversity on Corporate Boards Matter?There are many investors who simply believe that ensuring corporate boards with tremendous societal power represent the gender and ethnic breakdown of the communities they serve is its own intrinsic good. But most conversations have focused less on the values-based motivations often equated with ESG, and more on the financial materiality of diversity to shareholder value creation.Sticking to the traditional line of thinking that the board of directors of a company is supposed to be fully committed to maximizing shareholder value, numerous studies from pure-play financial actors over the past decade have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to

equity and inclusion policies, the evidence is clear: having a diverse team can help businesses make better, more empathetic decisions.At the top level, agrowing body of researchshows having more women on corporate boards leads to better decision-making, stronger governance and improved environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance.Yet, progress remains slow – even in New Zealand. Though we rank highly on theHuman Development Index, the countrylags behind in leadership gender equality.Women make up 50.8% of the population and hold 40.8% of parliamentary leadership roles. But they hold only 28.5% of board seats and 26.4% of executive roles in the New Zealand’s Stock Exchange (NZX) top 50 companies (the NZX50).And while businesses are encouraged to disclose gender diversity policies by the NZX, there are no mandatory quotas, leaving progress uneven.However, change is happening. Our newresearchlooked at the the percentage of female directors in NZX-listed firms between 2016 and 2022.What we found is positive. Using information from financial infrastructure and data provider LSEG’sdatabase on global financial markets, we identified a rise in the number of female directors on

it was “ adopting recruitment strategies that seek qualified leadership candidates with diverse experiences, skills and perspectives and expanding leadership development programs to continue promoting from within.”Southwest said in its 2024 annual report that “DEIB [diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging] is a part of the Company’s culture.”Southwest didn’t mention initiatives related to hiring more women and underrepresented minorities in the report, but had such mentions in its 2023 report.Airlines and DEIThe industry has beenslow to closeits gender and racial gaps. For example, around 80% of flight attendants are women. But only 8% are pilots, even with a significant increase in pushes to recruit more female pilots.Delta’s and United’s most recent ESG reports from 2023 say that women make up around 34% and 33% of senior roles, respectively.American, Delta, United and JetBlue also signed onto theInternational Air Transport Association’s “25 by 2025,”a pledge to increase female representation among corporate and frontline roles.DEI policies in corporate America took off in 2020 following the George Floyd protests. Many industries, including airlines, started publicly

85% of the companies originally targeted in CSRD, and would be in line with German and French demands.Meanwhile, a provision for so-called double materiality — a concept that requires companies to take into account not just the financial ESG risks they may face but also their environmental and social impact — looks to be intact, according to draft material seen by Bloomberg. Given the proposed cuts to CSDDD and CSRD, however, the provision would likely apply to fewer companies than originally intended.Read more:US Companies Say ESG Rules Are a Serious Barrier to EU TradeOther changes proposed by the commission include delaying CSRD reporting by a year and easing requirements around audits and climate transition plans.A spokesperson for the commission declined to comment, citing a policy of not responding to leaks.The proposal “will be a welcome development for CSRD reporters,” saidMichael Littenberg, global head ofRopes & Gray‘s ESG, CSR & Business and Human Rights compliance practice.
