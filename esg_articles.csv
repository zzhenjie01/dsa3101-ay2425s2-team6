How TIME and Statista Determined the World’s Best Companies of 2025 – Asia/Pacific,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",https://time.com/7221214/worlds-best-companies-2025-asia-pacific-methodology/,"ByTIME StaffFebruary 12, 2025 7:48 AM ESTTIME has published its first annual list of theAsia-Pacific's Best Companies of 2025, in partnership with Statista, a leading international provider of market and consumer data and rankings. The result of this quantitative study: 500 companies shaping the Asia-Pacific region's role in global business. Here's how the winners were selected.MethodologyThe research project ""Asia-Pacific's Best Companies of 2025"" is a comprehensive analysis conducted to identify the top performing companies in the Asia-Pacific region. The study was based on three primary dimensions: Employee Satisfaction, Financial Performance, and Sustainability Transparency (ESG).The first dimension, Employee Satisfaction, was evaluated using survey data from 2023 from employees worldwide with a main focus on the Asia-Pacific region. The surveys were conducted across the Asia-Pacific region with data collected from more than 50,000 participants. The evaluation encompassed evaluations of companies based on direct and indirect recommendations.The second dimension, Financial Performance, was assessed using data from Statista’s financial database and targeted research. The companies had to meet certain criteria to be considered for the evaluation, including generating a revenue of at least US $100 million in 2023. Companies also needed to either demonstrate positive revenue growth from 2021 to 2023 or generate a profit in 2023. Both relative and absolute financial performance were considered in the evaluation.The third dimension, Sustainability Transparency, was evaluated based on ESG data from 2022 among standardized KPIs from Statista’s ESG Database and targeted data research. To formulate a comprehensive ESG index, multiple data points were collected. For the environmental evaluation, this included the carbon emissions intensity and reduction rate, as well as the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) rating. The social dimension assessed the share of women on the board of directors and the existence of a human rights policy. The governance dimension evaluated whether a company had a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report adhering to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and a compliance or anti-corruption guideline. Additional consideration was taken for recent disqualifying events.Once the data was collected and evaluated, it was consolidated and weighted within a scoring model. The scores of all three dimensions were added on an equal percentage basis to form the final ranking score of a maximum of 100 points. The 500 companies with the highest score were awarded as the Asia-Pacific's Best Companies of 2025 by TIME and Statista."

                    subscribers.Become an Insiderand start reading now.Have an account?Log in.A highly visiblecampaign against DEIis underway against companies like Costco.Political pressure is putting execs into a delicate balancing act over how to run their businesses.Experts say diversity and inclusion are more baked into corporate culture than ever.Costco has found itself in the political crosshairs over diversity, equity, and inclusion, and now some corporate leaders are wondering who could be next.In the meantime, some are choosing to make tweaks or changes to their DEI policies.On Tuesday, Disney's HR chief told employees the company wasrebranding its DEI metrics and programsand changing the language of some content advisories.And last weekGoogle linked changes to its DEI initiativesto concerns about compliance with laws and executive orders, as the tech giant is a federal contractor.Though manylawsuits and shareholder proposals against DEI have failed, experts told Business Insider that the highly publicized challenges, including executive orders from the White House, could still have a chilling effect.Companies don't want to get into legal hot water, but they likely don't want to be seen as retreating from values they've espoused for years.The experts — two lawyers and a business researcher — said that, at the same time, the growing pressure on CEOs to eliminate their DEI practices might amount to little practical change in some workplaces.While some companies, most notably Costco, are digging in their heels in defense of DEI, others, like McDonald's, are taking a more conciliatory approach to the issue.DEI policies get a faceliftMichael Thomas, a California attorney specializing in corporate diversity practices at the law firm Jackson Lewis, said companies' main changes would most likely involve how they communicate about their policies, both internally and externally.Thomas said his firm had seen an increase in requests to review DEI initiatives for legal risks from clients who are also concerned about how employees and customers perceive them.He said a major piece of the firm's legal review is examining how companies communicate about their policies and practices on websites and in reports and other filings.Indeed, some of the changes at Disney appear to be about how the company talks about DEI.""What won't change is our commitment to fostering a company culture where everyone belongs and everyone can excel,"" Disney's chief HR officer, Sonia Coleman, said in a memo obtained by BI.Emphasizing style more than substance could suggest a likely path forward for companies that see diversity and inclusion as beneficial to their business.""EvenWalmartand McDonald's have conceded less than meets the eye,"" Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, told BI. ""They're keeping the same principles and objectives. It's just a question of nomenclature, metrics, and bureaucracies.""McDonald's, for example, said in its memo to franchisees that it was retiring ""aspirational representation goals,"" swapping a broad vendor DEI pledge for direct discussions with suppliers about inclusion, and changing the name of its diversity team to the global inclusion team.Sonnenfeld pointed to the way terms like sustainability, climate change, and pollution abatement have cycled through the corporate lingo while generally sharing an objective of protecting the environment.In many cases, diversity and inclusion have been around long enough that they're deeply embedded in corporate cultures, making them significantly harder to regulate, he said.""It's impossible to the point of insanity to try to ferret that out,"" he added. ""So the less modular it is, the less vulnerable they are.""Some companies may pull backStill, the anti-DEI pressure could have other companies shifting more drastically, said Jon Solorzano, a partner at the law firm Vinson & Elkins who advises public and private companies on areas related to ESG and risk management.He said that under the new administration, companies that may have been on the fence about DEI could decide to pull back some programs.""Different companies view this differently,"" he said. ""Those that are probably in the more consumer-facing world are particularly sensitive to the reputational risks on both sides.""Most of the major companies that BI has identified as retreating on DEI over the past year follow a pattern: ending representation goals that could be construed as quotas for hiring or sourcing, halting participation in rankings and surveys, and reassigning DEI-focused staff and resources.BI recently reported that whileAmazon changed language about DEI on its websites, a senior Amazon Web Services executive told employees in her division that there'd be ""no changes"" to key DEI-related benefits, including one for transgender employees.In December, Amazon's vice president of inclusive experiences, Candi Castleberry, said in a memo shared with BI that while the company was ending some ""outdated"" programs, it was part of an ""evolution to 'built in' and 'born inclusive,' instead of 'bolted on.'""Rebranding alone isn't an option at federal agencies under President Donald Trump's rules, which require a deeper review of a program's history. Private companies aren't subject to that level of government scrutiny — for now, at least.Last Wednesday, the newly sworn-in US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said the Justice Department intended to ""investigate, eliminate, and penalize illegal DEI and DEIA preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities in the private sector.""Companies ""really need to balance those risks,"" Solorzano said. ""What's more risky, the reputational harm of dealing with one of these investigations or having a mutiny of their employees?""Business leaders make a case for diversityLike Costco,JPMorgan has also defended DEIand is now the target of political and activist pressure.At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, CEO Jamie Dimon shrugged off an investor group's opposition to JPMorgan's DEI policies. In 2020 the bank started tracking executives' progress toward DEI goals, which affects their compensation, though it doesn't disclose the proportion of executive pay linked to DEI work.Solorzano said he believes there's likely to be a ""bifurcation"" of companies over DEI. While many companies in recent years have adopted DEI programs, he said, ""I also don't know that for every organization it was really core to their strategy.""""For places like Costco, it actually may be,"" he added.In a December statement to shareholders, Costco's board said diversity helped ""bring originality and creativity"" to its offerings, leading to greater satisfaction for its increasingly diverse customer base.A group of 19 Republican state attorneys general last month wrotea letter to Costco's CEO, Ron Vachris, expressing concerns about the company's compliance with state and federal laws, though they didn't identify any specific allegations of illegal practices.Solorzano said the scrutiny Costco is facing — and how Costco responds — is ""definitely being watched by all other major consumer branded companies right now.""Read nextCostcoTrump"
The Great Wealth Transfer: Managing Inheritance In Trusts,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewerskine/2025/02/13/the-great-wealth-transfer-managing-inheritance-in-trusts/,"MoneyWealth ManagementThe Great Wealth Transfer: Managing Inheritance In TrustsByMatthew F. Erskine, JD, Contributor.Matthew F. Erskine is a trusts and estates attorney.Follow AuthorFeb 13, 2025, 02:28pm ESTSave ArticleTrust and Estate Planning is shown on a conceptual business photogettyAs America stands on the cusp of the largest wealth transfer in history, with an estimated $84 trillion expected to change hands over the next two decades, both inheritors and wealth creators are increasingly turning to trusts as their preferred vehicle for wealth preservation and transfer, both during their lifetime and after their death. This shift represents more than just a technical change in how assets are passed down – it marks a fundamental transformation in how Americans think about inheritance and investment management.The New Face Of InheritanceThe traditional image of inheritance — a simple transfer of assets from parents to children — is rapidly becoming obsolete. Today's wealth transfer landscape is characterized by complex blended family structures, longer lifespans, and multitudes of increasingly sophisticated financial instruments. As a result, more Americans are discovering that trusts offer solutions to challenges that basic wills cannot address.The role of trusts has evolved from being purely about tax efficiency to becoming essential tools for responsible wealth management. Modern trusts need to balance multiple competing interests while protecting assets across generations.The Prudent Person ChallengeFor those receiving inheritances through trusts, one of the biggest challenges lies in investment management. The ""Prudent Man Rule,"" (now called the Prudent Person Rule) which has governed trust investments since the landmark 1830 case of Harvard College v. Amory, requires trustees to manage investments with the same care and skill that a person of prudence would use in managing their own affairs.This standard creates unique challenges for trustees, who must:First and foremost, fulfill the trust Grantor’s intent, which will determine the balance between the interests of current income beneficiaries (who want income) with future remainder beneficiaries (who need principal preservation)Navigate the two constant threats to portfolios, the corrosive effects of inflation and fees, while maintaining appropriate risk levelsAvoid emotional investment decisions while maintaining a long-term perspectiveCreate sufficient diversification while ensuring adequate liquidityMORE FOR YOUCrypto Braced For Another Trump Earthquake After Bitcoin, XRP, Solana And Cardano Price BoomOscars 2025 Full Winners List (Live Updates)Oscar Winners: ‘Anora’ Wins Best Picture While Adrien Brody And Mikey Madison Take Home Top Acting HonorsThe Modern Trust Investment LandscapeToday's trustees face additional complexities that their predecessors couldn't have imagined. The traditional ""buy and hold"" strategy, while still relevant, must now be balanced against modern portfolio theory and emerging, alternative, investment vehicles. However, certain fundamental principles remain paramount:1. Inflation Protection: With even modest inflation capable of halving purchasing power over a typical retirement span, protecting against inflation has become a critical concern for trust management.2. Asset Diversification: Modern trusts require careful diversification across both traditional and alternative investments, though the Grantor’s intent may result in the over-concentration in family businesses, legacy real estate, artwork and collectibles and other more speculative investments.3. Professional Management: The complexity of today's investment landscape often necessitates professional guidance, though trustees must maintain active oversight of those professionals and cannot completely delegate their responsibilities.Looking Forward: The Next Generation Of Trust ManagementAs we move deeper into the 2020s, several trends are emerging that will shape the future of trust management:Technology Integration: Digital platforms are making trust administration more efficient while providing better transparency for beneficiaries, who will expect immediate access to information and will not wait till the end of the month to receive a paper statement.ESG Considerations: Some beneficiaries will increasingly require that environmental, social, and governance factors be incorporated into trust investment strategies, while others will require maximization of returns regardless of the ESG considerations.Flexible Structures: Modern trusts are being designed with greater flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and beneficiary needs, this includes the ability to revise and restate an irrevocable trust through non-judicial settlements and decanting trust statutes when the trust is unable to fulfill the Grantor’s intent.Evaluating Inherited InvestmentsWhen inheriting assets in trust, beneficiaries often face the challenge of evaluating an existing investment portfolio. This evaluation requires a careful balance between respecting the original investment strategy while ensuring it remains appropriate for current conditions.Start by conducting a comprehensive review of all inherited investments, examining:The overall asset allocation and whether it aligns with the trust's purposesThe liquidity profile of investments and their ability to meet current distribution needsAny concentrated positions, particularly in family businesses or real estateThe tax implications of maintaining or modifying the current portfolioThe total cost structure, including management fees and transaction costsHolding Trustees AccountableBeneficiaries have both the right and responsibility to ensure trustees are managing investments prudently. Effective oversight includes:Regular review of detailed records of all investment decisions and their rationaleQuarterly performance reviews comparing results against appropriate benchmarksAnnual accountings of the transactions of the trust and review of investment policies and objectivesVerification that trustees are maintaining appropriate diversification and risk managementConfirmation that trustees are actively monitoring and adjusting investments when necessaryRemember that trustees cannot simply delegate investment responsibility to financial advisors – theymustmaintain active oversight and personal responsibility for investment decisions. Beneficiaries should expect regular communication and transparency regarding investment strategy and performance.Key Takeaways For Beneficiaries And TrusteesWhether you're establishing a trust or serving as a trustee, several key principles should guide your approach:1. Start with Clear Objectives: Document specific goals and investment policies that align with the trust's purpose. This can be a challenge when the Grantor’s intent is not clearly stated or when circumstances change over time.2. Maintain Professional Oversight: Regular reviews with qualified advisors ensure compliance and optimal performance.3. Focus on Long-term Success: Resist the temptation to chase short-term gains or react to market volatility.4. Keep Detailed Records: Maintain comprehensive documentation of investment decisions and their rationale. Require transparency on investment decisions, fees and discretionary distributions.The Path ForwardAs more Americans inherit wealth through trusts, understanding these vehicles’ complexities becomes increasingly important. Success requires balancing traditional prudent investment principles with modern portfolio management techniques while never losing sight of the trust’s fundamental purpose — protecting and growing assets for current and future beneficiaries.For the millions of Americans who will either inherit through trusts or serve as trustees in the coming years, the key to success lies in understanding that trust management is not just about preserving wealth — it's about preserving values, supporting families, and creating lasting legacies across generations.The most successful trusts are those that remember that money is not just about economics – it carries powerful emotional and symbolic value for families. As we enter this unprecedented period of wealth transfer, this human element of trust management may prove to be the most important consideration of all.For more on the topic of trustee selection, see:ForbesUnlocking The Secret To Trustee SelectionByMatthew ErskineForbesThe Challenge Of Trustee SelectionByMatthew ErskineAnd on the duties of a trustee, see:ForbesWhat Are the Duties of A Trustee?ByMatthew ErskineFollow me onLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"
Juventus FC Looks To Become Serie A’s Most Sustainable Soccer Club,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/vitascarosella/2025/02/12/juventus-fc-looks-to-become-serie-as-most-sustainable-soccer-club/,"BusinessSportsMoneyJuventus FC Looks To Become Serie A’s Most Sustainable Soccer ClubByVitas Carosella, Contributor.Vitas Carosella covers sports and society with a focus on climate.Follow AuthorFeb 12, 2025, 09:01am ESTSave ArticleCommentJuventus FC is a club synonymous with winning. Now it is matching its on-field success, with... [+]off-field action. The club has launched a new sustainability strategy ""Black, White and More"" to holistically tackle its environmental, social, and governance responsibilities.AFP via Getty ImagesJuventus FC is the latest European soccer club to launch a new sustainability strategy. Due to increased government regulation and pressure from fans, (environmental) sustainability has become a mainstream topic in soccer. As the flag bearer for Italian soccer, and Serie A’s most successful club, Juventus aims to lead the way on sustainability.The Turin giant unveiled its “Black, White, and More” strategy on December 17 ahead of the club’s 4-0 victory against Cagliari in the Coppa Italia Frecciarossa. The strategy’s title is an ode to the club’s traditional colors and conveys its desire to leave a stronger mark in this space.A New DirectionThe Black, White, and More strategy is a reconfiguration of Juventus’s approach to sustainability. Greta Bodino, the club’s Chief People, Culture, and Sustainability Officer, calls the new strategy a “turning point” for Juventus. She hopes it will show supporters a sense of transparency and that the club “feels the responsibility of what it is doing.”The 90-plus page document is broken into six pillars, two environmental, three social, and one governance. The strategy redefines the club’s ESG guidelines and harmonizes them with the ESG demands of Serie A, UEFA, and FIFA. Other objectives include aligning the club with the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and meeting increasing fan expectations.Counter to, or perhaps as a backlash to, soccer’s governing bodies’ revenue-at-all-costs approach, fans are increasingly seeking authentic commitments to social and environmental sustainability from their clubs. In a 2024Deloitte studyof Italian soccer fans, 75% of respondents aged 15 to 24 and 70% of those aged 25 to 34 said they would be willing to stop supporting their club if it did not fulfill its sustainability promises.MORE FOR YOUCourt Lets Trump Fire Watchdog Chief For Now: Here’s Where Trump And Musk Are Winning—And Losing—In Court‘Hamilton’ Cancels Kennedy Center Show Run In Protest Of Trump’s ‘Purge’Fox News Sets Record As Trump’s Speech Draws 32 Million ViewersThe writing is on the wall for clubs that refuse to take sustainability seriously: they risk losing their fanbase, and if climate change continues unabated, their existence. However, clubs like Juventus have a unique position in society. They have the capacity to motivate millions of people. Bodino wants Juventus “to be a club that inspires fans and communities.”Activating FansJuventus boasts roughly 180 million followers on digital platforms, plus many thousands of fans who live and breathe black and white but have no digital presence. The club is increasingly looking to integrate its fans into its sustainability journey and lead them by example.As Bodino explained to me before the strategy launch, “fans are everything” for Juventus and the club is looking to shift from a “desire” mantra to one that inspires fans to “act.” The club is leading by example by consistently reducing waste, improving its energy efficiency, and using its newly launchedCreator Labto deliver videos and campaigns that tackle major issues like racism and mental health.The Creator Lab doubles as a space where players and fans can interact directly, and an outlet for the club to show its social responsibility efforts to its fanbase. It combines digital marketing, fan engagement, and sustainability, and could help galvanize fans into action.Juventus ballboys wave a ""Black, White and More"" flag in honor of the club's new sustainability... [+]strategy.Courtesy of Juventus FCA Sustainability LegacyDespite being nicknamed “the Old Lady,” Juventus has kept up with the times. The 36-time Serie A winner has been doingsustainability reportingfor over a decade — though it has reported its carbon footprint only since 2019 — long before ESG was a popular term or the EU implemented the mandatory Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).Since the 2018-19 season, 100% of the electricity Juventus purchases has come from renewable sources. The club is also implementing LED lighting to increase energy efficiency at the stadium and training complex, and it is focused on improving circularity by minimizing waste through its 4Rs Approach; “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Recover.”Juventus also has a strong history of social responsibility. The club’s latest example of this can be seen on the front of its jersey. Juve’s front-of-shirt sponsor is the well-known NGO Save the Children. It partners with the non-profit to improve education in the local community. According to Bodino, Juventus has an educational hub a mere 300 meters from its stadium where the club offers teaching to kids from underprivileged backgrounds. The treat for most children is when players from the men’s or women’s teams go to visit them.Embedding Sustainability at JuveWithout buy-in from senior leadership, even the best of plans cannot be properly implemented. According to Bodino, Juventus has full commitment from its executives on its sustainability mission. The club has had a C-suite level ESG Committee in place since 2021. The Chairman, the CEO, and three other directors sit on the committee. All ESG directives, including the new strategy, have to be approved by the committee and then the board of directors, and direct responsibility for ESG planning and implementation falls in Bodino’s lap.Under her watch, the club launched an ESG steering committee as well. The three-person committee is up and running this season, but Bodino is not done embedding sustainability into Juventus’s personnel. She hopes to launch an “ESG People Committee,” that will offer workers a voice in the changes the club will implement. She says she will know her vision has become a reality when “people can feel that they can raise their voice, participate, and actually do things.”All Juve staff also have an ESG KPI linked to their profile. Every step that they take and every action that they make count towards their short-term sustainability objective. Bodino hopes that this helps show and improve employees’ commitment to sustainability.Juventus celebrates ESG Day on December 17, 2024 ahead of its Coppa Italia clash with Cagliari.Courtesy of Juventus FCScope 1, 2, and 3 EmissionsLast season, 2023-24, Juventus’s combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 6,166,920 CO2 e tons. That’s down from 6,328,510 CO2 e tons the previous season. The majority of the club’s Scope 1 emissions come from methane, while its Scope 2 emissions stem from district heating.The club is yet to measure its Scope 3 emissions, although Bodino says they will be doing that for the first time this season, in line with the EU’s CSRD regulation. Juventus had prepared to measure Scope 3 emissions several years ago, but those plans were delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic.For Bodino, getting the baseline emissions is “huge.” She expects a substantial spike in the club’s emissions numbers, noting that their partners at the University of Sant’Anna tell them 70% of emissions come from fan mobility. After establishing the club’s baseline Scope 3 emissions, Bodino will look at defined KPIs to reduce the club’s emissions over the coming seasons. Juventus will use fan surveys to assess how fans move to and from matches.Moving ForwardDespite Juventus’s decade-plus work on sustainability and its enhanced strategy, plenty of work remains. In the 2024Global Sustainability Benchmark in Sportsreport, which measures sports organizations based on their sustainability across four pillars, Juventus’s overall score was 71%; the top organization scored 85%.Juventus received strong corporate, social, and governance marks, but fell well short on the environmental pillar, scoring just 53%. That was well below some of its European compatriots like Borussia Dortmund (72%) and Atlético de Madrid (66%). However, the Italian giant performed far better than its Milanese rivals. A.C. Milan scored a lowly 22% on environmental sustainability, while Inter Milan barely cracked double digits at 10%.In the 2022-23Serie A Sustainability Indexconducted by Enovation Consulting, Juventus was classified as one of the “pioneers” of sustainability in Serie A alongside A.S. Roma, and Udinese Calcio. These clubs were deemed to be the ones demonstrating the best sustainability practices in Italy.Juventus remains at the forefront of sustainability in Italian soccer, but Italian soccer is well behind Germany, which implementedmandatory sustainability requirementsfor licensure several seasons ago, and England, where fan expectations around sustainability are much higher.When asked if Juventus will achieve its goal of halving its emissions by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2040, Bodino could only say “I hope so.” She notes that her answer is not for lack of commitment, it is just a realistic assessment of where the club is right now.Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"

Opinions expressed are those of the author.| Membership (fee-based)Feb 14, 2025, 01:15pm ESTSave ArticlegettyFinancial firms play a crucial role in environmental sustainability by integrating responsible practices into their operations and investment strategies. This approach doesn't just contribute to a healthier planet; it can also enhance a firm's reputation and resilience in an increasingly eco-conscious market.Below, 20Forbes Finance Councilmembers offer some best practices for financial firms to integrate environmental sustainability across their businesses. From embedding ESG criteria into decision-making to adopting green office practices, these approaches can help your firm reduce its carbon footprint and make a positive impact.1. Seek B Corp CertificationSustainability starts with commitment. Seek certifications like B Corp™ to signal your firm’s values and pave the way for continuous improvement in sustainability practices. By evaluating and investing in companies driving meaningful change, financial firms can amplify impact, lead by example and set themselves apart. -Sonya Thadhani Mughal,Bailard, Inc.2. Embed ESG Criteria Into Investment DecisionsFinancial firms should integrate environmental sustainability by embedding ESG criteria into investment decisions and asset management strategies. This includes prioritizing energy-efficient buildings, green financing and sustainable supply chains. Leveraging data-driven insights to track impact and aligning with regulatory frameworks ensures long-term value creation and resilience. -Aurele Gouy,Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield3. Retrofit Buildings With Green FeaturesBanks can demonstrate sustainability through their physical buildings by retrofitting existing structures with green features like energy-efficient heating and cooling systems and renewable energy sources like solar panels. Alternatively, they can choose LEED-certified or Net Zero buildings, reducing emissions while avoiding the environmental impact of new construction. -Monique Johnson,Beneficial State Bank4. Consider Evidence About Climate ChangeUse the available evidence about climate change and sustainable solutions. Try to avoid ideological considerations that individuals may have—at the end of the day, a business has to be prepared for a changing world. Consider a range of scenarios rather than rely on a single one, so that your business is prepared both for an optimistic and a pessimistic future. -Daniele Viappiani,GC1 Ventures5. Embed Sustainability Metrics Into Investment DecisionsA key best practice is embedding sustainability metrics into core investment and lending decisions through systematic ESG scoring frameworks. This allows firms to evaluate environmental impacts alongside traditional financial metrics when assessing opportunities, rather than treating sustainability as a separate consideration. -Joseph Lustberg,Upwise CapitalForbes Finance Councilis an invitation-only organization for executives in successful accounting, financial planning and wealth management firms.Do I qualify?6. Integrate Sustainability Into Core OperationsSustainability must be integrated into the organization’s core operations, influencing investment decisions, operational processes and employee engagement. For instance, one can prioritize green financing, enhance energy efficiency and align incentives with ESG outcomes transforming sustainability from a mere obligation into a competitive advantage while championing the planet. -Pankaj Vasani,Cube Highways InvIT7. Invest In Staff EducationOne best practice for financial firms to integrate environmental sustainability is investing in staff education. By providing training on sustainable finance principles, ESG risks and green investment strategies, firms empower employees to make informed decisions that align with sustainability goals. This fosters a culture of responsibility throughout the organizations. -Mahdi Yazdizadeh,Ereele Capital8. Establish A Climate Task ForceIntegrate environmental sustainability by embedding it within the risk management framework and aligning it with organizational strategy. Establish a climate task force with cross-business representation to drive initiatives, manage risks and capture opportunities. Use clear metrics and reporting to ensure accountability, promote resilience and meet stakeholder expectations for sustainable growth. -Shivali Kukreja,NIB NZ9. Identify And Measure Environmental Risks And OpportunitiesYou can't manage what you can't measure! Financial institutions can start by incorporating best practices from standard-setters such as the TCFD and ISSB to help identify environmental risks and opportunities. Measuring physical, GHG and transition risk in your operations, supply chain and portfolio allows for better governance across the business. -Martin Jarzebowski, CFA,Federated Hermes10. Integrate ESG Into Sales Strategies And Risk ManagementFinancial firms can integrate ESG by first embedding it into sales strategies and then risk management. For example, aligning business goals with sustainability agendas, like lending to the EV industry, incentivizes teams to execute integration. If that’s not feasible, environmental impact should be linked to risk assessment, ensuring it will become a risk factor in the SOP or scorecard. -Lechi (Richard) Zhang,Angel Investor11. Prioritize Supplier SustainabilityFinancial firms can integrate environmental sustainability by prioritizing supplier sustainability assessments in their procurement processes. Partnering only with vendors that meet strict environmental standards ensures alignment across the value chain. This not only reduces indirect emissions but also sets a precedent for responsible business practices, driving systemic change across industries. -Anushree Jain,Titan12. Foster An Organizational Culture Of SustainabilityFostering a culture of sustainability within a financial firm is crucial for achieving long-term environmental goals. Start by educating employees on the importance of sustainability and equipping them with the knowledge and resources to make informed decisions. Encourage a sense of responsibility and ownership among team members by involving them in goal-setting and decision-making processes. -JD Morris, RHC 21 LLC (a SPE Fund) with family of Special Purpose Entities (SPE or SPV)13. Incentivize Borrowers That Meet Sustainability TargetsFinancial firms can prioritize sustainability by incorporating it into their lending policies. Establish clear ESG frameworks and guidelines for evaluating projects, investments and clients. Offer green bonds, sustainability-linked loans and other financial products tied to environmental outcomes. They can also go on to incentivize borrowers and companies who meet specific sustainability targets. -Amit Jain,Dhruva Advisors (USACFO)14. Follow Guidelines Set By Local RegulatorsNo matter where you are in the world, your firm must follow the strict guidelines of your local regulator. Most financial regulators are now mandating ESG policies and firms must be transparent in their ESG disclosures. Following the lead of the regulators, one best practice for financial firms is to embed ESG considerations into their risk management and decision-making frameworks. -David T. Nudelman,Scandinavian Capital Markets15. Seek Out And Promote Green ProductsAdopt and promote sustainable finance initiatives that align operations and investment strategies with environmental goals. Specifically, search out green products and let clients and prospects know that they are available. -Bob Chitrathorn,Wealth Planning By Bob Chitrathorn of Simplified Wealth Management16. Embrace And Enhance Paperless SolutionsOne of the best ways for financial firms to implement environmental sustainability is to continue embracing and enhancing paperless solutions. By “going digital,” financial firms can significantly reduce their carbon footprint. Many firms have already embraced paperless solutions, but there is always room for improvement. -Jared Weitz,United Capital Source Inc.17. Conduct Sustainability Self-AssessmentsEmbark on a self-assessment to understand the firm's goals and how the services rendered directly and indirectly impact sustainability within and outside the firm. Incorporate sustainability in the company's impact strategy to leverage impact investment funding. -Oluwatoyin Aralepo,Africa Finance & Strategy Hub18. Align Investments With ESG PrinciplesFinancial firms can integrate environmental sustainability by aligning investments and operations with ESG principles. This includes offering green investment options, reducing their carbon footprint through digital transformation and partnering with eco-conscious organizations. Transparent reporting on sustainability efforts builds trust and positions the firm as a leader in responsible finance. -Andre Pennington,Pennington Law19. Implement Remote Work When PracticableOne best practice for financial firms to be environmentally sustainable is remote work. It eliminates commutes, reduces paper usage through digital files, and saves clients' resources by enabling virtual meetings. Additional efficiencies include less office energy use and reduced waste, making it a practical, eco-friendly solution that aligns with sustainability goals. -Patrick Lonergan,Vital Wealth20. Adopt Green Finance PracticesFinancial firms can integrate environmental sustainability by adopting green finance practices, such as investing in renewable energy projects and offering eco-friendly financial products.

ISS Announcement Raises Key Questions About DEI And Fiduciary Duty,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/morgansimon/2025/02/18/iss-announcement-raises-key-questions-about-dei-and-fiduciary-duty/,"MoneyInvestingISS Announcement Raises Key Questions About DEI And Fiduciary DutyByMorgan Simon, Senior Contributor.Morgan Simon covers the intersection of finance and social justice.Follow AuthorFeb 18, 2025, 11:30am ESTSave ArticleCommentData has indicated that DEI is material to company stock performance, leading to questions regarding... [+]ISS's recent decision.A monitor displays stock market information on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, the United States, on Feb. 3, 2025. (Photo by Michael Nagle/Xinhua via Getty Images)Xinhua News Agency via Getty ImagesTypically voting is thought of as a highly personal decision and practice. And yet, in the world of public markets, most investors that take the time to vote their proxies tend to actually outsource these decisions, or at least, the research behind them, to just two companies: Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis.According to the Wall Street Journal, they have cornered approximately 97% of the proxy voting market, giving them the power to sway voting by as much as 30%. Translating this into electoral politics, it’s as if two companies controlled the electoral college votes for all seven swing states, plus Florida and Texas.And that means that any major announcement of voting policy changes by these companies has the power to move markets–such as last week’s announcement from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) that they will no longer consider race or gender in their board of director recommendations.Investors controlling trillions of dollars concerned with the well-documented benefits of diversity to corporate performance now need to look elsewhere to protect their investments. This is still possible through more expensive, custom voting options at ISS, or the use of proxy voting tools likeIconik, but adds significant friction to voting that could ultimately interfere with companies getting to an optimal board of director composition from the perspective of enhancing shareholder value.ISS Policy Change: Diversity Will No Longer Be Considered in Board of Director Election RecommendationsOn February 11th, ISS released the following statement:“Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) annually conducts a thorough, rigorous, and transparent policy review to consider updates to its Benchmark policy and its Specialty policies for the upcoming proxy season. On an exceptional basis, ISS also considers updates to its policies in light of relevant legal and regulatory changes and/or other emerging issues affecting investors and their portfolio companies.MORE FOR YOUCourt Lets Trump Fire Watchdog Chief For Now: Here’s Where Trump And Musk Are Winning—And Losing—In Court‘Hamilton’ Cancels Kennedy Center Show Run In Protest Of Trump’s ‘Purge’Fox News Sets Record As Trump’s Speech Draws 32 Million ViewersIn the United States, there recently has been increased attention on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, including the issuance last month of Presidential Executive Orders on DEI. We anticipate that institutional investors and U.S. companies will have a range of perspectives on DEI, including whether and how companies can or should adapt their specific policies and practices to the evolving market and governmental activity.In light of these developments, ISS will indefinitely halt consideration of certain diversity factors in making vote recommendations with respect to directors at U.S. companies under its proprietary Benchmark and Specialty policies. Specifically and for shareholder meeting reports published on or after February 25th, ISS will no longer consider the gender and racial and/or ethnic diversity of a company’s board when making vote recommendations with respect to the election or re-election of directors at U.S. companies under its Benchmark and Specialty policies. Assessments and vote recommendations on directors of U.S. companies will continue to be evaluated under the other considerations outlined in the Benchmark and Specialty voting guidelines (accessiblehere) including independence, accountability and responsiveness.ISS will continue to review its Benchmark and Specialty guidelines as appropriate.”The timing of this announcement raised eyebrows, as it was on the tail of ISS recommending investors voteto maintain DEI policies at Apple just four days prior. It’s raising questions within the investment community as to whether these changes are based on assessments of financial materiality, or more about aligning with political shifts in the country. This in turn raises broader concerns for investors about how proxy voting services like ISS will treat broader DEI issues, climate change, and other issues that sit at the nexus of fiduciary duty and political debate. (ISS did not respond to multiple requests for comment).Kate Monahan of Trillium Asset Management, an ISS SRI client for over a decade with over $5 Billion in AUM noted, “I am shocked and disappointed they made this change. We are certainly not going to stop voting in favor of DEI given the materiality of the issue and importance to our clients. I am particularly concerned that this announcement happened outside of the standard investor feedback process, raising serious questions about the rigor of internal decision-making processes for such a substantive shift.”Other investors expressed frustration at both the process and outcome, asreported in the Responsible Investor. The New York City Retirement Systems is a client of ISS. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander commented on their behalf, “ISS knows that diverse boards help companies perform better and they have helped build the evidence proving the case. I can only conclude that they are afraid of the increased regulation that the SEC sought to enact during the first Trump Administration. Rather than standing up for independent proxy advice, they are preemptively throwing the value of diverse governance under the bus.”Why Does Diversity on Corporate Boards Matter?There are many investors who simply believe that ensuring corporate boards with tremendous societal power represent the gender and ethnic breakdown of the communities they serve is its own intrinsic good. But most conversations have focused less on the values-based motivations often equated with ESG, and more on the financial materiality of diversity to shareholder value creation.Sticking to the traditional line of thinking that the board of directors of a company is supposed to be fully committed to maximizing shareholder value, numerous studies from pure-play financial actors over the past decade have shown that race and gender diversity in corporate leadership are critical ingredients to maximizing performance:The Credit Suisse Research Institutefoundthat “gender diversity—or the greater representation of women—in senior roles was not just ‘nice to have’ but linked to excess stock market returns and superior corporate profitability.”The Boston Consulting Group found thatdiverse management teams had 19% more revenuegenerated from innovation.According to McKinsey,companies with top-quartile performance on gender diversity within executive teams were25% more likely to have above-average profitability, and 36% higher performance in the case of ethnically diverse teams. In general, McKinsey has issued four reports over the past decade noting the value of diversity, statements that have beenrecently contestedin Econ Journal Watch.This reflects the overall trend towards ESG investments for the presumption of enhanced returns. Ina 2022 survey from Price Waterhouse Coopersof over 250 asset owners reflecting just under half of global assets under management (AUM), PWC noted they expect over $33 Trillion in ESG products by 2026, and over 20% of global AUM by 2027 to be ESG. This report concluded, “Belying questions of whether financial and ESG performance might conflict, nine of ten asset managers surveyed believe that integrating ESG into their investment strategy will improve overall returns. What’s more, a majority of institutional investors, 60%, reported that ESG investing has already resulted in higher performance yields, compared to non-ESG equivalents.”Where Do Investors Go from Here?This announcement echoes the broader trend of companies pulling back from DEI, to the consternation of many investors who are worried about how this could impact corporate performance. Similarly, Goldman Sachs announced that they willno longer require companies to have diverse boardsat the time of IPO, and other companies like Google and Amazon have back-tracked on DEI in moves an Associated Press/Fortune.com piece characterized as“capitulating to Trump’s war on DEI.”In response to a request for comment, Goldman Sachs provided a statement from spokesperson Tony Fratto, noting, “As a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy. We continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach.”Amazon responded noting their commitment to “creating a diverse and inclusive company,” providing a copy of an internal communication from VP Candi Castleberry noting they are “winding down outdated programs and materials” related to DEI. Google did not respond to a request for comment.For investors who currently use ISS recommendations and want to make sure they continue to factor in diversity’s materiality to corporate boards, it may be necessary to consider custom voting strategies and alternative providers such asAs You Vote. Investors can also seek to address DEI through other areas of portfolios such as proactive investment into privately-held companies that value equity and inclusion as part of their human capital strategy.When politics and fiduciary duty collide, many investors ultimately believe that fiduciary duty must win. Eric Darrisaw, board member of the Interfaith Center on Investor Responsibility, a coalition of 500+ investors managing over $4 Trillion in assets, noted,“Human capital is not a social issue. It’s a balance sheet issue, and a disclosure issue with serious legal implications for companies. TheSEC Human Capital Ruleadopted during the Trump administration requires US companies to disclose information related to their human capital management, including workforce diversity. This rule is part of a broader push ensuring that companies report on issues that are deemed material to their financial performance and operations.Not only does avoiding DEI lead to legal risk, acquiescing to politics and ignoring the materiality of DEI can lead to ESG ratings downgrades for companies seeking access to theover $120 Trillion in capital aligned with the UNPRI signatories. While companies may be trying to follow the political weather, they cannot hide from the reality that DEI is financially material, and therefore must be evaluated and disclosed to investors. Research has decisively shown DEI leads to improved corporate performance, so cannot be ignored as a strategy.""Full disclosures related to my work availablehere.

Today’s Leadership Won’t Save The Planet – Or Your Business,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/esmtberlin/2025/02/14/todays-leadership-wont-save-the-planet--or-your-business/,"LeadershipLeadership StrategyToday’s Leadership Won’t Save The Planet – Or Your BusinessByESMT Berlin, Contributor.ESMT offers business education in leadership, innovation and analyticsFollow AuthorFeb 14, 2025, 08:30am ESTSave ArticleCommentBy Sarah Horn and Joanna Radeke,ESMT BerlinFor nearly two decades, Tom thrived as a leader in a multinational corporation. An engineer at heart, he drove breakthrough innovations, solved complex challenges, and earned the respect of his peers. An executive MBA helped him climb the ranks, sharpen his strategic instincts, and deliver steady business results.Lately, Tom has noticed a shift. The challenges he once tackled – technical problems, traditional workforce management, operational hurdles – now feel secondary to bigger, systemic forces. Climate risks, geopolitical pressures, social polarization, and evolving employee expectations dominate leadership discussions. Success no longer hinges on quality and efficiency alone; it requires bold decisions, a long-term vision, and a willingness to act before the market catches up. For Tom, the question isn’t just how to lead – it’s how to lead in a way that truly lasts.Mature man looking away contemplating at officegettyThe world needs changeTom isn’t the only one recognizing this shift. Leaders across industries are grappling with similar challenges. Investors now scrutinize ESG commitments, employees seek meaningful work and inclusive workplaces, and customers expect businesses to align with their values. Sticking to past strategies is no longer an option.Accordingly, theGlobal Risks Report 2025, published by the World Economic Forum, highlights that environmental and social instability account for a third of all global risks, with extreme weather, deepening social divides, regulatory uncertainty, and resource scarcity reshaping business strategies.MORE FOR YOUCourt Lets Trump Fire Watchdog Chief For Now: Here’s Where Trump And Musk Are Winning—And Losing—In Court‘Hamilton’ Cancels Kennedy Center Show Run In Protest Of Trump’s ‘Purge’Fox News Sets Record As Trump’s Speech Draws 32 Million ViewersNavigating these pressures takes more than incremental adaptation. Strong corporate leadership means balancing profit with long-term vision and responsibility for people and the planet. The question is no longer whether businesses should prioritize sustainability and inclusion, but how leaders will turn those priorities into action.The leadership skills gapTom built his career solving complex challenges, but the nature of those challenges has changed. The technical expertise and strategic planning that once defined strong leadership are no longer enough on their own. As industries face environmental challenges, shifting societal expectations, and evolving workforce dynamics, leadership must evolve too. TheFuture of Jobs Report 2025, published by the World Economic Forum, ranks environmental stewardship, leadership, and talent management among the top skills expected to shape the workforce in the years ahead.Yet, how can leaders mitigate global risks and meet short-term business demands while driving long-term, meaningful change? The answer lies in mastering a new set of leadership competencies – ones that integrate sustainability and inclusion into decision-making and strategic priorities.Inclusivity and stakeholder engagementLeadership today requires engaging and balancing the interests of a diverse range of stakeholders – including employees, customers, investors, governmental bodies, local communities, and advocates for environmental and animal rights. This means challenging long-held beliefs, addressing power imbalances, and fostering collaboration across diverse interest groups, which requires an inclusive leadership approach. Inclusive leadership starts with self-knowledge – understanding the origins of one’s own perspectives and biases improves decision-making, deepens connections, and builds trust, thereby helping organizations and their broader ecosystems to thrive.Sustainability and environmental stewardshipLike inclusivity, ignoring sustainability is no longer a choice – leaders who delay action risk regulatory penalties, financial instability, and eroded stakeholder trust. On the other hand, those who take a proactive approach to environmental challenges are better positioned to navigate market shifts, attract top talent, and drive innovation. As industries adapt to new climate realities, the leaders who embed sustainability into strategy will be the ones thriving in the face of disruption.Targeting sustainabilitygettyA case study in leadershipAt ESMT, we are convinced that leadership today calls for more than technical expertise or operational excellence. Sustainability and inclusion are not just ideals—they are practical skills that define a company’s ability to compete and endure. But recognizing this shift is only the first step; the real challenge lies in equipping leaders with the skills to put these principles into practice.Our collaboration with Siemens Energy demonstrates what this looks like in action. Their ESG strategy focuses on two key areas: decarbonizing their business and ensuring responsible operations, including a focus on inclusion and diversity. As part of its ambitious efforts, Siemens Energy needed a way to integrate sustainability into all operational processes and strategic decisions across functions. Together, we developed a training program that empowers employees beyond dedicated ESG roles to upskill and confidently navigate regulations, assess ESG impacts, and implement sustainability solutions. As businesses face growing regulatory and market pressures, this kind of leadership development will be essential for organizations looking to lead rather than follow.The leadership imperativeThe challenges shaping today’s business landscape – climate risk, shifting workforce expectations, and regulatory pressures – are not passing trends. They are defining forces that will determine which organizations thrive and which fall behind.Success in this era depends on the ability to inspire, engage, and lead with purpose – creating a future that is resilient and responsible for all. Leaders of the future do not just need to be capable of managing major complexities but recognize that sustainability and inclusion are essential pillars of long-term business success.Tom’s challenges have changed, and so has his focus on leadership development. Our future depends on leaders like him – those who are ready to step up and invest in the skills that truly matter.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades"

Companies are facing increasing pressure from critical stakeholders to address their environmental impact with a plan that spans social responsibility, governance, and long-term risk management.Meanwhile, on the regulatory front, global directives call for organizations to adopt a more rigorous, transparent approach to sustainability reporting.Customerpriorities are also shifting, with many assessing a company’s sustainability credentials before making purchasing decisions. These increased pressures are squeezing businesses to make radical changes, and fast.Charissa JaganathSocial Links NavigationHead of Responsible Business at Logicalis.How sustainability is reshaping operationsDisney+ Limited Time Offer: Save 40%* on one year of Disney+ PremiumThe intricacy of today’s regulations means businesses cannot treat sustainability as a siloed function. For example, The European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) requires businesses to carry out double materiality assessments looking at both financial impacts and how a company's operations affect society and the environment. This transcends mere compliance. ESG will have to be thoroughly incorporated at every level of the business, from risk management andHRto legal and finance. What may once have been seen as ‘immaterial’ issues, such as supply chain or energy use across non-core operations, are now being scrutinized. To ensure compliance, companies must build a cross-functional strategy.You may likeWhat data centers should consider to establish more sustainable operationsSatellites, AI and blockchain: the unsung heroes in sustainability innovationFor businesses that are not yet ready, it is important to recognize that compliance leeway will not last forever. Non-compliance will begin to carry real financial, legal and reputational risks as early as this year. Failing to plan now will mean businesses face a harsher wake-up call down the road.Businesses will also need to demonstrate progress on plans.Spreadsheetswill no longer cut it as organizations get audit-ready, with evidence-backed data to comply with stringent requirements. Real-time data collection and automation tools will be useful as businesses keep track of their headway. This shift will also elevate the role of tech leaders, as data integration and interpretation become crucial for understanding and driving ESG performance across the organization.The business caseThe pressure to comply with regulations is just one side of the coin. There is a compelling business case for embracing sustainability at a strategic level.As more consumers and business partners seek to align with companies that share their values, a commitment to sustainability has become a competitive differentiator. Businesses are increasingly being evaluated based on their sustainability performance. The 2024 Logicalis CIO report found that 90% of CIOs said that they assess the sustainability credentials of new suppliers before working with them.At the same time, sustainability is playing an increasingly important role in attracting and retaining top talent. In today’s workforce, especially among younger generations, there is a growing expectation for businesses to lead by example when it comes to inclusivity, diversity, and environmental stewardship. We found that 84% ofemployeesare more likely to work for companies that prioritize environmental issues. Companies that fail to showcase these values risk being left behind.The cost-saving potential of embedding sustainability at every level can also not be overlooked. Smart sustainability investments such as carbon offsetting, circular economy models and smart building systems can bring long-term cost savings that will be impossible to ignore. In an environment where profit margins are often squeezed, the ability to drive savings through smarter, more sustainable practices provides a distinct advantage.As regulatory changes make ESG reporting a corporate mandate, organizations can unlock their full potential by integrating sustainability into every business decision. In doing so, companies can attract top talent, build customer loyalty, and establish themselves as industry leaders. Beyond the immediate compliance benefits, embedding sustainability into core operations makes businesses more resilient, agile, and future-ready. With sustainability now a crucial part of business operations, it must be prioritized at every level to ensure long-term success.We've featured the best green web hosting.This article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

How To Build Trust In The Voluntary Carbon Market,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2025/02/12/how-to-build-trust-in-the-voluntary-carbon-market/,"Small BusinessHow To Build Trust In The Voluntary Carbon MarketByRomain Pison, Forbes Councils Member.forForbes Business CouncilCOUNCIL POSTExpertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author.| Membership (fee-based)Feb 12, 2025, 08:45am ESTSave ArticleRomain Pison, CEO ofNoviCarbon- an entrepreneur and decarbonization expert known for his work in ESG and green infrastructure.gettyThe voluntary carbon market (VCM) has grown into a cornerstone of global climate action, channeling billions of dollars into projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, as its significance has expanded, so have doubts about its reliability. Criticisms of greenwashing, concerns about low-quality carbon credits and a lack of transparency threaten to undermine its potential.For the VCM to play a credible role in decarbonization for corporates and businesses, trust must be its foundation. Drawing on my experience in sustainable infrastructure, decarbonization strategies and ESG leadership, I'll be highlighting key challenges facing the VCM andhow businesses and corporations can take practical measures to invest in the VCM and the future of their companies.The Stakes: Why Trust In The VCM MattersAt its best, the VCM enables corporations to offset unavoidable emissions while supporting critical projects like reforestation, renewable energy deployment and biodiversity conservation.However, the market’s rapid growth hasbrought scrutiny. Some companies use carbon credits as a license to continue unsustainable practices, undermining genuine efforts to reduce emissions. Additionally, not all carbon credits represent tangible, verifiable benefits. Weak methodologies and inadequate oversight have allowed questionable credits to persist. And stakeholders often struggle to trace how their investments translate into measurable environmental outcomes.The result is a market caught in a tug-of-war between its promise and its pitfalls, and businesses are often left with more questions and concerns than clear answers and solutions. For the VCM to scale as a credible decarbonization mechanism, I believe that we must actively build trust through transparency, accountability and demonstrated impact.Building Trust: Three Pillars Of A Credible Carbon Market1. Adopt rigorous standards.Standards like theCore Carbon Principles (CCPs)provide a foundation for credibility by emphasizing key attributes such as:• Additionality:Ensuring projects would not occur without carbon credit funding.• Permanence:Guaranteeing long-term carbon storage.• Third-Party Verification:Relying on independent assessments to validate impact.For instance, theGold Standard and Verra frameworksrequire projects to meet stringent criteria. Yet inconsistent adoption of these principles can undermine market confidence. Companies can take actionable steps by prioritizing carbon credits certified by recognized, high-quality standards; incorporating third-party verification into their procurement processes to ensure reliability; and regularly auditing their carbon credit portfolios to align with evolving benchmarks.From my experience managing infrastructure portfolios across 40+ markets at the World Bank, I’ve seen that governance frameworks are more than technical necessities—they are trust-building tools. When businesses integrate robust standards into their operations, they can not only mitigate risk but also inspire confidence among stakeholders.2. Leverage technology for transparency.Emerging technologies can revolutionize how the VCM operates. For instance, by creating an immutable ledger,blockchaincan help ensure that every transaction—from issuance to retirement—is traceable. Buyers can confirm that credits are unique and effective. AI monitoring is another technology to consider, as machine-learning algorithms can analyze real-time data from carbon projects, identifying inconsistencies or underperformance early.Organizations like Toucan and KlimaDAO are already leveraging blockchain to track the lifecycle of carbon credits. A 2023 report by theWorld Economic Forumhighlights how blockchain solutions are improving transparency in carbon markets. Business leaders can support these innovations by:•Investing in and using platforms that integrate blockchain for real-time credit tracking.•Partnering with technology providers to develop custom solutions that enhance project monitoring.•Advocating for industry-wide adoption of transparent digital tools to set a new standard for accountability.3. Foster multi-stakeholder collaboration.The VCM does not exist in isolation; it intersects with corporations, governments, investors and NGOs. Corporations can help facilitate effective collaboration by embedding voluntary offsets within their broader emissions reduction strategies rather than using them as substitutes for meaningful change. Here are a few ways you can amplify impact:• Align offsets with broader strategies.Carbon credits should complement emissions reduction efforts, not replace them. Integrating offsets into comprehensive ESG frameworks can help you ensure meaningful decarbonization.• Engage in collaborative initiatives.For example, programs like the LEAF Coalition mobilize corporate funding for large-scale conservation projects. A Reuters report highlighted LEAF’s success in protecting millions of acres of tropical forests, showcasing thepower of collective action.•Demonstrating climate leadership.Microsofthas committed to becomingcarbon negative by 2030, pairing high-quality carbon credits with deep operational emissions cuts. This approach sets a benchmark for others in the market.•Leverage innovative financing.Mechanisms likegreen bonds and performance-linked loansare unlocking new capital for carbon projects. In emerging markets, where traditional funding is scarce, these instruments could provide scalable solutions for financing high-impact initiatives.The Path Forward: A Call To ActionThe voluntary carbon market stands at a critical juncture. I believe that now is the time for business leaders to act decisively and shape the future of their companies. Here are a few steps you can take to help build a sustainable and trustworthy VCM:• Adopt Standards:Ensure your company’s carbon credit investments meet rigorous benchmarks like the Core Carbon Principles.• Leverage Technology:Integrate blockchain and AI tools to enhance transparency and accountability across your operations.• Collaborate:Partner with governments, NGOs and other corporations to align offsets with comprehensive climate strategies.As someone deeply committed to advancing sustainable infrastructure and combating climate change, I believe the VCM, through the businesses that are carbon credit buyers, must evolve beyond a transactional marketplace. It should become a collaborative ecosystem—one where financial investments from businesses translate into measurable, lasting climate benefits for our ecosystems and our economies.Forbes Business Councilis the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.Do I qualify?Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"
Acting SEC Chair Says Climate-Related Disclosure Rule Is Illegal,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmcgowan/2025/02/12/acting-sec-chair-says-climate-related-disclosure-rule-is-illegal/,"MoneyActing SEC Chair Says Climate-Related Disclosure Rule Is IllegalByJon McGowan, Contributor.I am an attorney who writes about ESG policy, laws, and regulations.Follow AuthorFeb 12, 2025, 12:24pm ESTSave ArticleCommentFILE - The seal of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at SEC headquarters, June 19, 2015,... [+]in Washington.(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.On March 6, 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule. The final rule required large publicly traded companies to disclose climate action, greenhouse gas emissions, and the financial impacts of severe weather events. The rule was immediately met with legal challenges and was delayed while the court heard the cases. On February 11, acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda began the process to permanently end the rule, leaving climate advocates and businesses that heavily invested in reporting reeling.Following the Paris Agreement in 2015, a series of global initiatives were pursued to reduce the impacts of climate change and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero. This resulted in a carbon credit market that allowed high GHG emitting countries and businesses to purchase credits from underdeveloped countries that produce little emissions.On the financial side, a multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms,like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces.This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry. Funds that claim to be ESG, green, climate friendly, or sustainable must back up those claims with data. As a result of demand and Paris Agreement based initiatives, international regulators began drafting standards for reporting, marketing, and investments relating to climate change and other green initiatives.In 2021, the International Sustainability Standards Board drafted the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation’s Sustainability Disclosure Standards. IFRS is an independent, nonprofit organization that develops financial reporting standards, including international accounting standards. IFRS is not used in the U.S., who uses generally accepted accounting principles, also known as GAAP, but is used in 132 jurisdictions. The IFRS Standards were adopted in June 2023 as the global standard for sustainability and climate change reporting, including greenhouse gas emissions.MORE FOR YOUCourt Lets Trump Fire Watchdog Chief For Now: Here’s Where Trump And Musk Are Winning—And Losing—In Court‘Hamilton’ Cancels Kennedy Center Show Run In Protest Of Trump’s ‘Purge’Fox News Sets Record As Trump’s Speech Draws 32 Million ViewersIn the U.S., the SEC proposed the development of climate-related reporting standards in March 2022. The final rule, adopted on March 6, 2024, required large publicly traded companies to disclose climate action, GHG emissions, and the financial impacts of severe weather events.The Climate-Related Disclosure Rule was initially set to go into effect in 2026. However,it was immediately met with legal challengesand the SEC delayed implementation indefinitelywhile the cases worked through the judicial process. Now it appears the delay will become permanent.Under the leadership of Gary Gensler, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission saw a wave of regulatory and enforcement actions relating to environmental, social, and governance; sustainability; and climate change. It was clear that his exit, effective the day President Trump took office,would significantly alter the SEC’s approach to those topics.On February 11, acting SEC Chair Uyeda, a Biden appointee, effectively ended the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule.In the statement, Uyeda said,“The Rule is deeply flawed and could inflict significant harm on the capital markets and our economy.”“Both Commissioner Peirce and I voted against the Rule’s adoption. Commissioner Peirce said that then-existing disclosure rules were sufficient and that the ‘[R]ule’s anticipated benefits do not outweigh the costs.’ She argued that ‘only a mandate from Congress should put us in the business of facilitating the disclosure of information not clearly related to financial returns.’ I stated that the Commission was ‘without statutory authority or expertise’ to address climate change issues and that ’this [R]ule is climate regulation promulgated under the Commission’s seal.’”“The Commission’s briefs previously submitted in the cases consolidated in the Eighth Circuit do not reflect my views… I also question whether the agency followed the proper procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act to adopt the Rule.”As a result, Acting Chair Uyeda has asked the court for a delay in the proceedings while the SEC takes action to rollback the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule. As a result, climate reporting at the national level is effectively dead. The focus now turns to the states and international actions.Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"

[+]departments as they make our way through 2025.gettyTo err is human, but some public companies are testing the limits of forgiveness. According to anew analysisfrom Ideagen Audit Analytics,the number of U.S. public companies with accounting errors so serious that they needed to withdraw their financial statementsreached a nine-year highlast year. All told, some 140 U.S. public companies had to withdraw and reissue their financials due to serious errors that were caught after the fact. The findings underscore some serious challenges confronting corporate finance departments as we make our way through 2025.While much of thenews coverageof this phenomenon has focused onfailings in the audit function, the deeper issue is the increasingly complex web of intertwined details multinational companies are now managing across their tax, finance, legal and risk and compliance functions. There was once a time when the corporate tax function could afford to operate happily in its own little corner of the business, tracking payables and receivables, and diligently reporting on a quarterly basis. Now, the tax department is at the center of a regulatory, technological and professional revolution that has teams tracking more variables than ever before — many of them in real-time — while projecting new risks and protecting against current ones, often withsmaller staffs and shrinking budgets.The Complexity EconomyToday’s corporate finance, tax, risk and legal professionals are in a high-stakes environment where commerce and compliance are inextricably linked. Take a typical M&A transaction for example. With global M&A volumesprojectedto jump 15% this year, reaching a total of $3.45 trillion, acquisitions are sure to be a fixture in the corporate tax, finance, risk and legal playbook in 2025. Many companies will quickly find, however, that the work that goes into vetting, onboarding and reporting these deals has gotten considerably more complex in recent years.Beyond the basics of complementary business structures and alignment around strategic customers, companies considering an M&A transaction must now also factor countless risks and regulatory exposures into the equation, incorporating everything from geopolitical volatility to environmental, social and governance concerns. In fact, according to Deloitte’s2024 ESG in M&A Trends Surveysome 72% of M&A transactions were abandoned over the last two years due to ESG concerns alone.Add to those concerns the growth of e-invoicing andreal-time, transaction-level tax reporting, which now require companies in many jurisdictions around the world to report taxes in real-time at the point-of-sale, country-by-country tax reporting requirements being implemented in line with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’sBEPS Pillar 2initiative and countlesspending regulationsfocused on sustainability reporting, and the plot thickens further. Did I mention the new administration in the U.S., which is sure to introduce a new batch of variables to incorporate into the mix?MORE FOR YOUCourt Lets Trump Fire Watchdog Chief For Now: Here’s Where Trump And Musk Are Winning—And Losing—In Court‘Hamilton’ Cancels Kennedy Center Show Run In Protest Of Trump’s ‘Purge’Apple Takes No Risks With New M4 MacBook AirHarmonizing Disparate Corporate FunctionsWith all of these moving parts affecting all aspects of every move a modern company makes, there is a fair amount of inconsistency and confusion out there when it comes to who’s responsible for coalescing everything and developing a clear path forward. Is it the CEO? Chief Financial Officer? Chief Operations Officer? Chief Risk Officer? Chief Legal Officer? Chief Tax Officer? Increasingly, the corporate responsibility possession arrow is pointing to all of them. The fact is, each department plays a critical role in achieving business success, but they must be able to work in concert to achieve business goals without ending up on the wrong side of the countless risks they face.That brings us back to all the errors showing up in public company financial statements. Those errors are not the root problem; they are symptoms of a much larger set of challenges affecting all companies right now. To address them, businesses need to start breaking down silos that have historically kept individual business functions separate. The interconnected nature of risk and compliance issues, spanning multiple functions, operations and processes requires companies to be able to share data, analytics, expertise and insights in ways they have previously never done. And it needs to happen yesterday.The Next MoveOf course, making this pivot is easier said than done. Breaking down antiquated structures requires a huge operational change that affects everything from the C-suite to individual departments to frontline employees. While these problems seemingly exist in their own vacuums, they’re all interconnected, and businesses need to realign their data, systems and processes to address this new normal.Only by having a fully integrated, 360-degree view of their businesses can businesses adequately anticipate and confront the volatility that awaits them in 2025 and beyond.Follow me onLinkedIn.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"
Colorado Bill Would Require Businesses To Disclose Climate Emissions,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmcgowan/2025/02/17/colorado-bill-would-require-businesses-to-disclose-climate-emissions/,"MoneyColorado Bill Could Require Businesses To Disclose Climate EmissionsByJon McGowan, Contributor.I am an attorney who writes about ESG policy, laws, and regulations.Follow AuthorFeb 17, 2025, 06:44pm ESTSave ArticleCommentDenver, Colorado USA:Gold plated roof top of the Capitol Building of Denver ColoradogettyColorado has joined the wave of states considering requiring businesses to disclose greenhouse gas emissions. This follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announcing it will eliminate the reporting requirement that was adopted in 2024, but never went into effect. If passed, businesses with a presence in Colorado and over $1 billion in revenue will be required to start reporting as soon as 2028.Following the Paris Agreement in 2015, a series of global initiatives were pursued to reduce the impacts of climate change and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050.A multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms,like BlackRock, used their influence to drive sustainability and environmental, social, and governance. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces.This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry. Funds that claim to be ESG, green, climate friendly, or sustainable must back up those claims with data. As a result of demand and Paris Agreement based initiatives, international regulators began drafting standards for reporting, marketing, and investments relating to climate change and other green initiatives.In 2021, the International Sustainability Standards Board drafted the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation’s Sustainability Disclosure Standards. IFRS is an independent, nonprofit organization that develops financial reporting standards, including international accounting standards. IFRS is not used in the U.S., who uses generally accepted accounting principles, also known as GAAP, but is used in 132 jurisdictions. The IFRS Standards were adopted in June 2023 as the global standard for sustainability and climate change reporting, including greenhouse gas emissions.In the U.S., the SEC proposed the development of climate-related reporting standards in March 2022. The final rule, adopted on March 6, 2024, required large publicly traded companies to disclose climate action, GHG emissions, and the financial impacts of severe weather events.The Climate-Related Disclosure Rulewas initially set to go into effect in 2026. However,it was immediately met with legal challengesand the SEC delayed implementation indefinitelywhile the cases worked through the judicial process. In February,the acting chair of the SEC announcedthat the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule was in the process of being repealed.MORE FOR YOUCourt Lets Trump Fire Watchdog Chief For Now: Here’s Where Trump And Musk Are Winning—And Losing—In Court‘Hamilton’ Cancels Kennedy Center Show Run In Protest Of Trump’s ‘Purge’Apple Takes No Risks With New M4 MacBook AirFocus now shifts to the states. In September 2023, California approved the Climate Accountability Package, a pair of bills aimed at creating sustainability reporting requirements. Senate Bill 253 required companies that do business in California and have an excess of $1 billion in revenue, defined as “reporting entities,” to submit an annual report for Scope 1 and Scope 2 starting in 2026. Scope 3 reporting will begin in 2027.California is still drafting the applicable regulationsand thereporting timeline is likely to be delayed.Now, Colorado is following suit.House Bill 25-1119, titled “Requiring Certain Entities to Disclose Information Concerning Greenhouse Gas Emissions,” was introduced on January 28 by state representative Manny Rutinel, a Democrat. The bill mimics the requirements of the California legislation.Reporting entities is defined as “an entity that does business in Colorado and has total revenues exceeding one billion dollars in the preceding calendar year, including revenues received by all of the businesses entity’s subsidiaries that do business in Colorado.” The scope of “does business in”has come into question in Californiaand is causing problems for businesses trying to determine if they fall under the reporting requirement or not. It will be interesting to see how Colorado addresses this issue.The reporting of Scope 1, the direct GHG emissions of the company, and Scope 2, the GHG emissions of their energy provider tied to the business’ energy consumption, will begin reporting by January 1, 2027, for the 2027 annual year.Scope 3 reporting will be phased in using a unique definition. Broadly, the bill defines Scope 3 as GHG emissions “other than Scope 2, that are from sources that a reporting entity does not own or directly control. ‘Scope 3 Emissions’ may include emissions associated with a reporting entity’s supply chain, business travel, employee commutes, procurement, waste, and water usage, regardless of location.”By Jan. 1, 2029, companies will need to disclose Scope 3 emissions from the 2028 calendar year from ""purchased goods and services, capital goods, and the use of sold products.""By Jan. 1, 2030, companies will need to disclose Scope 3 emissions from the 2029 calendar year from “emissions from fuel and energy activities, which emissions are not classified as Scope 1 emissions or Scope 2 emissions; waste generated in operations; processing of sold products; and the end of life of sold products.”By Jan. 1, 2031, companies will need to disclose Scope 3 emissions from the 2030 calendar year from “upstream transportation and distribution, business travel, employee commuting, upstream leased assets, downstream transportation and distribution, downstream leased assets, and franchises.”Notably, the timing of the reporting requirement is, in my opinion, unobtainable. It is unreasonable to require businesses to report GHG emissions from the preceding calendar year on January 1. Most jurisdictions allow six months for businesses to process the information and compile the reports. I expect this will be change as the bill goes through the legislative process.Unique to Colorado, enforcement is delegated to the district attorney and attorney general. If a business fails to comply with the disclosure requirement, they may be prosecuted and face a penalty of $100,000 per day. I expect that to be reduced or otherwise amended.It is too early in the legislative session to predict the chances the bill will make it through the Colorado General Assembly and become law. Democrats control both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Likewise, Governor Jared Polis is Democrat. This greatly increases the likelihood the bill will make it through the legislative process. However, do not underestimate the business lobby’s efforts to kill the bill or make substantial changes.Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"
EU Weighs Easing Corporate Liability Under Toughest ESG Law,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Insurance Journal'}",https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/02/12/811722.htm,"EU Weighs Easing Corporate Liability Under Toughest ESG LawByJohn Ainger|February 12, 2025Email ThisSubscribe to NewsletterArticle0 CommentsThe European Union is reviewing the extent to which companies can be held liable for environmental and human rights breaches in their supply chains, ahead of a package designed to remove red tape from the bloc’s ESG regulatory framework.The European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, will try to better align reporting standards across the three main pillars of its environmental, social and governance rule-set later this month. Plans to cut reporting requirements — especially for small and medium-sized companies — have been well-flagged, but officials are now also looking at ways to ease rules that require firms to clean up their value chains under theCorporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, or CSDDD.“Civil liability is one of the topics we are looking at,” said Valdis Dombrovskis, the commissioner in charge of the EU’s push to simplify regulations. We are assessing “what kind of legal certainties companies are having, how many layers up and down the value chain they should actually be monitoring and able to influence.”US Companies Say ESG Rules Are a Serious Barrier to EU TradeBusinesses operating in the EU have complained that the legal liability they face under CSDDD represents an unacceptable risk. At the same time, activists defending environmental and human rights causes hold the directive up as an example of what ESG rules should aspire to. As the framework currently stands, CSDDD infringements could result in fines of as much as 5% of a firm’s global revenue.Cutting red tape is one of the biggest priorities for the EU as it tries to stay competitive with the US and China. The commission is due to present its first so-called simplification omnibus on Feb. 26, in which it will address several pieces of ESG legislation at once. Besides CSDDD, the omnibus will target the EU’s Taxonomy Regulation and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.Dombrovskis said that the package would likely also include adjustments to the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. Wopke Hoekstra, the EU’s climate commissioner, said that 80% of companies would be exempt.Photograph: Flames from a flare stack at an oil refinery.

Project 2025: The End Of Education As We Know It?,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/solangecharas/2025/02/14/project-2025-the-end-of-education-as-we-know-it/,"LeadershipCHRO NetworkProject 2025: The End Of Education As We Know It?BySolange Charas, Contributor.Solange Charas covers the intersection of governance, HR, and finance.Follow AuthorFeb 14, 2025, 12:37pm ESTSave ArticleCommentSchool BusGetty ImagesIn this installment of our series examining Project 2025's potential impact on corporate governance, finance, and human capital, we focus on its proposed elimination of the Department of Education (DOE). While framed as a move to return control of education to the states, this shift could have far-reaching consequences for employers and the workforce, both today and in the future. Understanding these potential changes is crucial for businesses preparing for an evolving labor landscape.Dismantling the Department of Education - What's at Stake?The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 outlines a blueprint for dismantling the DOE, arguing that education should be entirely state-controlled and free from federal oversight. However, the NEA claims it woulddevastate public education. (Read more about the DOE's history in a previousForbes column.) Among Project 2025's proposals:Eliminating Federal Student Aid Programs:Pell Grants, federal student loans, and loan forgiveness programs would be cut, shifting the burden of financing higher education entirely onto individuals and private institutions.Privatization and School Choice Expansion:The plan promotes voucher programs and charter schools while reducing funding for public K-12 education, potentially increasing disparities in education quality across states.Elimination of Federal Workforce Training Grants:Programs supporting vocational education and adult workforce retraining would no longer receive federal funding, leaving businesses to fill skill gaps on their own.Defunding DEI and Workplace Readiness Programs:The proposal aims to eliminate initiatives promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in education, which may impact the talent pipeline for employers focused on fostering diverse and innovative workforces.Who Will Be Hurt If the DOE Is Eliminated?According to the think tank,Century Foundation, the elimination of the DOE will harm a broad range of individuals and organizations.College Students, Including Diverse Populations and White Men Equally:The elimination of federal financial aid will disproportionately impact students from lower-income backgroundsacross racial and gender lines. While students of color have historically relied on federal financial aid at higher rates, white men also make up a significant portion of student loan and Pell Grant recipients. Without these financial supports, both groups will face significant challenges in accessing and affording higher education, leading to a shrinking talent pool across all industries.Businesses Needing a Skilled Workforce:Without federal support for education, companies will struggle to recruit workers with the necessary skills. Industries that depend on technical expertise, such as STEM, healthcare, and finance, will face acute shortages.Unemployed and Low-Income Individuals:The elimination of workforce retraining programs will leave many job seekers without pathways to gain new skills, worsening employment prospects and economic inequality.Public School Students and Teachers:Federal funds support special education, rural schools, and low-income districts. Losing this funding could lead to teacher layoffs, larger class sizes, and fewer educational resources.Rural and Underserved Communities:Many small towns and economically disadvantaged regions rely on federal education support for broadband access, transportation, and teacher recruitment. Losing DOE funding will further disadvantage theseareas.Preparing for Project 2025 - Actionable Steps for CompaniesHuman Capital Practitioners will need to rethink recruitment and retention strategies in response to a shrinking and underprepared talent pool. Without federal workforce training initiatives and student financial aid, companies may see fewer qualified applicants for skilled roles, particularly in technical and knowledge-based industries. To prepare, practitioners should:Invest in Internal Training and Upskilling:Companies will need to increase investment in workforce development programs, including apprenticeships, on-the-job training, and tuition reimbursement initiatives.Expand Partnerships with Educational Institutions:Collaborating with local community colleges, trade schools, and private institutions can help bridge skills gaps through customized training programs.Enhance Employee Value Propositions:With fewer college-educated job candidates, HR leaders should refine benefits packages, career progression opportunities, and other incentives to retain top talent in a more competitive labor market.Financial Implications - Rising Costs and Economic UncertaintyThe elimination of the DOE will place increased financial pressure on both businesses and employees. Without federal support, the cost of educating and training the workforce will shift to private employers, making it more expensive to maintain a competitive edge. Companies must:Plan for Higher Training and Development Budgets:The cost of workforce development will rise as companies take on responsibilities once managed by federally funded education programs.Assess the Long-Term Impact on Labor Costs:As skills shortages intensify, businesses may need to offer higher wages or sign-on bonuses to attract and retain qualified employees.Adapt Compensation Strategies:Organizations should explore more flexible compensation structures, including performance-based incentives and non-traditional benefits, to mitigate the financial burden on employees who face rising education costs.MORE FOR YOUCourt Lets Trump Fire Watchdog Chief For Now: Here’s Where Trump And Musk Are Winning—And Losing—In Court‘Hamilton’ Cancels Kennedy Center Show Run In Protest Of Trump’s ‘Purge’Fox News Sets Record As Trump’s Speech Draws 32 Million ViewersCorporate Governance Considerations - Addressing Workforce Risks and Compliance ChallengesFor board members and corporate governance leaders, the elimination of the DOE presents new compliance and operational risks that must be managed proactively. Companies must:Incorporate Workforce Readiness into Risk Management Plans:Workforce shortages and skill gaps should be factored into enterprise risk assessments, with strategies to address potential labor shortages.Ensure Compliance with Changing Labor Laws:Shifting education policies may introduce new workforce compliance challenges at the state level, requiring more vigilant legal oversight.Enhance ESG and Social Responsibility Strategies:With educational inequities expected to widen, companies committed to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles should consider taking a more active role in education initiatives, such as scholarship programs and school partnerships.ConclusionThe elimination of the Department of Education would fundamentally alter the relationship between education and the workforce, shifting the responsibility for workforce development from the government to private industry. HR leaders, financial professionals, executive teams and board directors will need to address widening skills gaps. There will be an expected rising training costs, and corporate governance professionals will navigate a more fragmented labor landscape.While Project 2025 proponents argue that decentralizing education will improve efficiency, the reality for businesses is clear: the absence of federal oversight and funding will create new risks and costs that corporate leaders cannot afford to ignore. The question is not whether companies should prepare for this potential reality — it is how soon they must act to safeguard their workforce and long-term viability.For a more in-depth analysis of Project 2025's implications, you may refer to my previous columns on this topic (forbes.com).Follow me onLinkedIn.Check outsome of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades"
The Great Political Sort Is Happening At the Office,"{'id': None, 'name': 'The Atlantic'}",https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/02/the-politics-of-work/681639/,"PodcastsThe Great Political Sort Is Happening at the OfficeSocial workers are Democrats. Real-estate brokers are Republicans. What does your job say about your politics?ByJerusalem DemsasIllustration by The Atlantic. Source: Getty.February 11, 2025ShareSaveListen-1.0x+0:0054:33Subscribe here:Apple Podcasts|Spotify|YouTube|Overcast|Pocket CastsEvery personal detail is a tell. From your choice of college major, to the industry you work in, to the company within that industry—each decision is part of a sorting phenomenon populating certain workplaces with Democrats and others with Republicans.We’re socialized to not talk politics at the office to avoid polarizing issues that could break norms of professional behavior. But according to a new study from two Harvard researchers, that norm may have obscured a startling partisan divide at the workplace: Republicans and Democrats are sorting into different fields of study, industries, and companies.Workers aren’t just pawns in this partisan sorting; they’re actively choosing it, although perhaps subconsciously. As the study authors Sahil Chinoy and Martin Koenen found, “The median Democrat or Republican would trade off 3% in annual wages for an ideologically congruent version of a similar job.”“Is [3 percent] big or small?” Chinoy asks. “It’s less than something like health care. It’s sort of actually comparable in magnitude to some of these softer amenities, things like having a relaxed versus a fast pace of work, for example, or having training opportunities at work. People seem to care similarly about the ideological nature of the job.”The following is a transcript of the episode:Jerusalem Demsas:I have a bit of a weird job for several reasons, but for one: Many of my colleagues’ varied ideological commitments are pretty clear due to the nature of our work.But I was curious about what workplaces look like in less overtly political places. Do people often know the political opinions of their colleagues and bosses? Could work be a place for the healthy mixing of people with different partisan identities?Probably not. At least, that’s what I take away from a new paper called “Political Sorting in the U.S. Labor Market,” which argues that political segregation is extremely common in the workplace. According to the authors, “a Democrat or Republican’s co-worker is 10 percent more likely to share their party” than what you might expect based on where their workplace is located.Why? Well, it’s largely because workers are opting into college majors, jobs, industries, and companies that correspond with their partisan identities. Republicans are more likely to have studied business, finance, engineering, and technology, while Democrats are more likely to have studied the arts, social sciences, and the humanities.Industries themselves are therefore more likely to have employees of one party rather than the other, but even within industries, companies are attracting one party’s adherents over the other.My name’s Jerusalem Demsas. I’m a staff writer atThe Atlantic, and this isGood on Paper, a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives. My guest today is Sahil Chinoy, who co-authored this paper while finishing up his economics Ph.D. at Harvard. Sahil himself is on the job market, I’m sure headed to one of those ideologically diverse workplaces so common in academia.Sahil, welcome to the show.Sahil Chinoy:Thank you. Thanks so much for having me.Demsas:So before you conducted your research project, did you think that workplaces were more or less segregated than other areas of life, like neighborhoods, schools, etcetera?Chinoy:I think somewhat less. We’ve all heard this idea that there should be, quote, “no politics at work.” And I think I took that to heart and thought the workplace might be a uniquely important site where there’s less partisan or political segregation than some of the other environments that we inhabit, like schools and certainly neighborhoods. There’s a lot of attention paid to partisan segregation, particularly across space, across neighborhoods.And I do think that I thought that the workplace would exhibit less sorting than that. How much less? I don’t know. I certainly thought that it can’t be the case that it’s perfectly even.Demsas:Yeah, I mean, it’s like when you’re young, and you’re in, like, K-12 or something, it’s the time of your life when you’re repeatedly kind of interacting with people you didn’t choose to be interacting with. It’s your teachers, other kids at school.And when you grow up, work is basically one of the only times when you’re being forced to go anywhere that you are not actively choosing who you’re going to be interacting with. Obviously, there’s a ton of segregation that comes from where people are in school.But I think the fact that, like, this is arguably the only place that adults are interacting with people that they’re not opting into on a regular basis—that leads people to kind of feel like,Oh this is probably, like, the most generative space for reaching people across the partisan aisle.But you do not find this. So walk me through your paper. What did you do to investigate whether workplaces were segregated by party?Chinoy:Yeah. So just one point on that. I think that’s exactly right. I think the idea here is, like, people have less ability to choose who their co-workers are compared to other people that they interact with, and that’s what generates segregation.I will note, though, that—it’s kind of funny. When I bring this point up to academics and to professors, there’s sort of the one group, I think, that doesn’t really see this. They’re like,What do you mean? We can perfectly choose who our colleagues are.Demsas:(Laughs.) That’s, in fact, the whole point.Chinoy:That’s what hiring is. That’s the whole point. But I think generally, yes. I think that’s the idea.So we’re sort of starting with this basic premise that, you know, maybe the workplace is less politically segregated than some of these other environments—not such a hard question to pose or to ask. I think it’s just a hard question to answer.And it’s a hard question to answer, I think, primarily because of a data constraint. We have very high-quality and large-labor-market surveys in the U.S., but they don’t ask questions about politics or partisan affiliation. And we have large and high-quality political surveys, but they usually don’t ask questions about where exactly people work. And even if they did, they’re large, but they’re not large enough to really capture who is working with whom.And so the starting point of this paper is really to say we have this pretty, to some extent, obvious question: To what extent do Democrats work with Democrats and Republicans work with Republicans? And how are we going to answer it? And the way we answer it is by combining two sources of information: On the one hand, public LinkedIn profiles—so scraped LinkedIn profiles that list where everyone works and some other characteristics about them, often where they went to college or their educational background. And we combine that with administrative voter records.And so in the U.S., who you vote for is not public. But in 30 states and the District of Columbia, which party you register with is public. And so we combine those two sources of information, and that lets us see who is working with whom and everyone’s party affiliation. And that’s how we can quantify the magnitude of this partisan segregation at work.Demsas:So you find that “a Democrat or [a] Republican’s co-worker is 10 percent more likely to share their party than expected based on local partisan shares.” Can you just unpack that finding? What does that mean?Chinoy:Yeah. So the idea is: We want to benchmark the share of your co-workers who share your party affiliation against what we might expect. And so, you know, to give you a concrete example, say you are a Democrat, and you work at Google in Mountain View, then a high share of your co-workers are fellow Democrats. I think it’s something like 55 percent in our data. So that’s, you know, a relatively high share of Democrats. But what should we actually expect? Should we benchmark that against the share of Democrats in the U.S. as a whole?And so our baseline measure takes that sort of realized share of co-partisans—so the 55 percent of Democrats that share your workplace—and divides it by the share of Democrats in your local labor market, which we operationalize as a commuting zone. Commuting zones are sort of aggregations of counties that are precisely designed to capture these kinds of commuting patterns, who could reasonably share your workplace.And it turns out—I’m going to forget the exact number, but you know, it turns out—that share is quite high for Google in Mountain View. So you’re a Democrat at Google Mountain View—your co-workers are 6 percent more likely to share your party affiliation than you would expect based on the local shares of Democrats and Republicans. And then we generalize that for everyone. We do that for every person in our sample, tens of millions of people, and that’s how we arrive at that 10 percent number.Demsas:This is, I think, a really great way of putting it, because, obviously, someone’s going to say, you know,Okay, Google—you’re in California. You’re in Silicon Valley. This is just a high-Democrat place,so are you just, like, looking at, basically, that there is geolocation sorting that’s already happening?And you’re saying it’s not just the fact that, like, there are locational differences in partisanship. It’s that even taking that into account, workplaces are even more segregated based on party than you would expect just by, like, walking around and taking a random sampling of people who live in the commuting zone that Google is in.Chinoy:Yeah, that’s exactly right. And, you know, I can compare against the national shares, and if I do that, that number is 20 percent. It’s twice as high as the baseline statistic that I quoted for you earlier. And that’s a meaningful number, too, but what sort of intuitively accords with people’s sense of how to measure partisan segregation? It’s probably comparing against the local environment. And that’s why that 10 percent number is kind of our preferred estimate.Demsas:How does this compare to the level of partisan segregation that we observe in other places? We know, for instance, that there’s partisan segregation happening in schools or in dating markets and churches and stuff like that. Is the workplace the most segregated based on party in America, or is this in line with other places?Chinoy:Yeah, so it’s hard to answer this directly for every other social environment or every other group of people. I can tell you a couple things. So one is: I think a natural comparison is residential partisan segregation. This is something that people study a lot, right—the extent to which Democrats live on the same block as Democrats, and Republicans live next to other Republicans. And so we can sort of compare what I told you—that 10 percent number, that overexposure ratio—against partisan segregation across neighborhoods.And you can define neighborhoods in different ways. One way to do it is a zip code. And when we do that, we find that partisan segregation at work is pretty similar. So, like, a little bit less than but overall pretty similar to partisan segregation across zip codes. We can go one step further and say, you know, maybe the zip code is a little bit bigger than what you have in mind when you think of neighborhood-level sorting. And so we have individual addresses in our data, and so we can say, you know,You have 15 co-workers. Let me figure out how many of them share your party affiliation, and let me look at our sample of the 15 people who live closest to you and figure out how many of those people share your party affiliation.And when we do that, we find that workplace-level segregation, workplace-level overexposure ratio is a little bit less pronounced than that sort of nearest neighbor level of segregation, but still pretty similar, not so different. It’s not orders of magnitude different. So that’s kind of why we say that it’s a little less pronounced than residential segregation as a whole but still pretty sizable.This isn’t in the paper, but we can also look at colleges. That’s the other thing that we can really observe well in our sample, and when we do that, we find that colleges are less segregated along party lines than our workplaces.Demsas:Wow.Chinoy:And sorry—that’s college cohorts.Demsas:Wait. Sorry. Can you break that down? College cohort—you mean, the people who went to your college and then are in the class of 2017 as well?Chinoy:Exactly. Yes.Demsas:Okay, so that group, the people who went to my college and are in the same class as me, are less segregated than my workplace? Well, maybe not me, in particular, but on average.Chinoy:Yeah. And I think a lot of that is just the size of these groups. College cohorts are quite big compared to workplaces, which tend to be relatively smaller. And so there’s a little bit more room for that kind of political diversity in college cohorts. And so the extent to which you think that’s an apples-to-apples comparison, I think it is up for debate because of that size issue.Demsas:So you’re not going to take the hard position that colleges are more open than workplaces in America? (Laughs.)Chinoy:I wouldn’t say they’re more open, but certainly you’re in this group of people that, for many people, is quite large and might include people from diverse geographic backgrounds. That’s also something that happens at colleges.Demsas:So is this a function of income or racial or gender segregation? Like, how much of this can be explained by the fact that our workplaces are segregated by factors that are correlating with partisanship but are not partisanship, in particular?Chinoy:Yeah, that’s a great question, I think a natural question. I think it is important to note, though, that overall, like, what is the phenomenon of interest? It’s partisan segregation without differencing out all of those other background characteristics, right?And I think that there’s an analogy to gender segregation at work. You know, to what extent is gender segregation at work driven by different occupational choices? The different occupations that men and women sort into or are sorted into—that’s sort of an interesting question. At the end of the day, that’s part of the phenomenon of interest. That’s part of what creates segregation at work. And so I think a similar thing applies here.That said, we can do, I think, the kinds of exercises you have in mind, where, instead of benchmarking just against the share of Democrats and Republicans in your local labor-market area, in your commuting zone, we can additionally incorporate information about those co-workers in predicting their partisanship.And so what I mean is: If we knew not just where your co-workers lived, in terms of which commuting zone they live in, but also their exact year of birth and their gender and their race—things which are, as you know, very correlated with partisanship and politics in the U.S.—would we still be surprised that Democrats disproportionately work with Democrats, and Republicans disproportionately work with Republicans? So these are pretty fine predictors, right? We actually interact [based on] year of birth and gender and race. So for me, you know, an Asian male born in 1995 tends to be registered with the Democratic Party at a particular rate. We can incorporate that information and say,Is it still the case that we see this partisan sorting?And we find that, indeed, that explains some segregation but certainly not all of it. And we can add even more predictors, so not just the education level of everyone, whether they went to high school or college or have a postgraduate degree—again, something that’s highly correlated with partisanship—but also the exact college that they went to. And we can show there are partisan differences across schools.And we can incorporate that information as well. We can incorporate not just the exact college that you went to but what you studied when you were there. And there, again, we see large gaps in the college major choices of Democrats and Republicans, which I think actually is independently quite interesting also. So college and major and then industry and occupation—we can incorporate all of these predictors, and we still find that a Democrat or Republican’s co-worker is about 4.3 percent more likely to share their partisanship than we would expect. So we bring that ratio down from 10 percent to 4.3 percent. All of these things clearly matter, but they don’t explain all the segregation that we see.Demsas:I think that’s really significant. I think when I first saw your abstract, I was like,Okay, well, is this just like,Black people are Democrats, and women are Democrats, and men are Republicans, when we’re looking at averages?And seeing that significant difference even without that—and I mean, I take your point well that looking at partisanship is relevant, even if it is the case that race and gender are playing into that. Like, that overall partisanship still tells you something about workplaces in America.But I also want to ask, because I think in your paper that you’re seeing more heterogeneity for different income bands and educational attainment, that there’s a different level of partisan segregation for people who make more money or for people who have, you know, graduate degrees or college degrees.Can you tell me about that? What’s going on there?Chinoy:Yeah, so that’s exactly right. You know, the 10 percent number that I was quoting for you before is an average across everyone in our sample. We can see what that looks like among subgroups and, in particular, we can see what that looks like among subgroups defined by education and by income.When we do that for education, we see something pop there, which is that people with postgraduate degrees, people who are more highly educated, tend to be in workplaces that are more segregated. And there’s a little bit of something going on for high-school graduates versus people with bachelor’s degrees, but really where it tends to stand out the most is people with a postgraduate education.Demsas:It’s you, Sahil. You’re causing all our problems.Chinoy:(Laughs.) I mean, yeah, like, kind of, though, right? And you can think of stories why this might make sense. Maybe these people have more of an ability to choose an employer that really aligns with their ideological interests in a way that isn’t true for other groups of workers. I can’t say for sure why.Demsas:Or they’re more motivated, right? Like, you might be more ideological or partisan.Chinoy:Totally. Also true. And, actually, on that point, when we subset to people who have made campaign contributions and might be more politically motivated or politically interested kind of in the way you were describing, we also see that those people are experiencing more segregation at work, particularly the people who donate to very liberal or very conservative candidates.And then you also asked about income. And here we see a little bit less of a clear pattern, actually. So the gradient seems more pronounced for education than for income. There’s a bit of a technical point here, which is that we don’t know someone’s exact income in the LinkedIn data. You don’t put them on your LinkedIn profile, mostly. So we infer it from where people live, based on the block group that they live on, and so you might worry that’s sort of an inexact measure of income, but the education measure we have is more specific. We try to do some things to alleviate that concern.Overall, we stand by the idea that the gradient is stronger for education than for income.Demsas:But for income, higher-income people are more likely to have a more-segregated workplace?Chinoy:Barely, among our sample. And our sample is people who have LinkedIn profiles, and so that’s a higher-income slice of the population than the overall workforce. And among that sample, we don’t see too much in terms of the highest-income people among them experiencing more segregation than the lowest-income people.Demsas:This is a bit afield from your specific paper, but I remember there being a lot of talk about how diverse workplaces were more creative, and I think that literature is actually kind of more mixed, so I don’t know how good that literature actually stands up. But there’s a lot of talk about how having kind of ideological diversity, background diversity, etcetera can make for more creative teams. Does your research look at whether these sorts of workplaces, you know, have any impact on productivity? Do you have thoughts on whether that would play out, given other research you’ve looked at?Chinoy:Yeah, it’s a great question. I think that’s the next paper I want to write.Certainly, there are countervailing forces here. It’s probably bad for, you know, workplaces to have 100 percent people who think a certain way. That seems not optimal. It also seems like you probably want to be able to get along with your co-workers to some extent. And, you know, if partisanship and political affiliation is a measure of that, then, probably, a little bit of homophily might actually be productive. So my speculation is that there would be a bit of a U shape there. I don’t know for sure. I think that would be super interesting to study.I think that where people do study this question, specifically, is among corporate leaders. It’s been, like, historically, a little bit easier to get information about the political affiliation and donation behavior of executives and board members, and so people have focused on that. There is one paper that basically claims that increasing political polarization of corporate America is not in the financial interest of shareholders. I’d have to remember exactly what they study in that paper, but I think they’re looking at the alignment between corporate executives and their boards, the political alignment, and looking at what happens when they leave.Demsas:Yeah, we can put that paper in show notes for people to take a look at if they want.There’s another paper—also, we’ll put that in the show notes—from Christopher Rosen last January [2024], and they found that employees experience negative affect after overhearing political conversations at work. Essentially, the effects are amplified when employees think their co-workers are less similar to them. So you’re more negative when you overhear someone who’s a Democrat, and you’re a Republican having kind of a conversation. And they’re attenuated when you overhear someone who has your viewpoints or you feel like it’s aligned with your ideological or partisan goals.And so that seems pretty straightforward there, and I agree, these countervailing forces here feel difficult to sort out, particularly because an individual firm’s goal might be to increase the amount of good feelings that people within their company feel, but an industry or our goal as a society to try to create the most productive companies might be to have a lot more frictions happening in the workplace for the societal benefits that might bring.It’s also like, the incentives are also countervailing here. There’s not really an incentive from workplace leadership, maybe, to try and make their workplaces more diverse in ideology, which I feel like is why there was such a push to try to find productivity benefits from ideological diversity—to try to incentivize this kind of corporate shift. But it seems rough.Chinoy:I think that’s a good point. And I think the other thing I would add is that the conversation we just had is kind of focused on the interests and the efficiency and productivity of companies and workers. We also might have a social interest in partisan mixing and people who don’t think the same way politically interacting with each other.Again, this is the kind of thing that, on its face, seems right. Like, we probably want people to interact with people who don’t think like them. Actually saying why that is good, politically, is not terribly obvious. Is it going to reduce support for, like, political violence or things like that? Probably not.I think people have shown that people don’t generally believe in that kind of thing anyways. But you know, the extent to which I think mixing between Democrats and Republicans is good for our politics, I think that’s sort of another reason to be interested in this issue.Demsas:Yeah, I want to emphasize for listeners, we’re not saying that, like, all these workplaces—and you’re not finding that all these workplaces—are 100 percent Democrat or 100 percent Republican. It’s just more likely to be. And so people might look around and say,I know the conservative at my job, and it’s like,Yeah, you knowtheconservative at your job.So I think what you just said kind of segues into another finding in your paper, which is that there’s a persuasive aspect to this too. Just to tell you my prior, I feel like if I was constantly surrounded by very right-wing people at my job, I would probably only become more left-wing. But I do think that maybe your paper indicates that that effect is not the same for everyone—or maybe I’m just wrong about myself. Maybe I would be persuaded. But tell me about that finding. What did you see?Chinoy:Yeah, so the story there is mixed. I don’t think what you’re saying is wrong about yourself. So the idea here is: What could explain political segregation? Well, one channel that could explain political segregation is sort of this conformity effect. People become like their co-workers, like their workplace over time. If I end up in a workplace with a lot of Democrats, I might be more likely to affiliate with the Democratic Party, and sort of vice versa with Republicans.This has been shown, actually, with neighborhoods, and so people tend to adopt, to some extent, the partisanship of their neighbors or the people that they live around. And so we were interested in whether something similar could be happening at work. I’ll spare you the details of exactly how we estimate this, unless you want me to get into it, but the basic finding is that we find that the workplace can causally affect people’s partisan affiliation but only for people who don’t start out as committed Democrats or Republicans.And so you’re not really getting people to change their mind. I think that’s kind of consistent with, perhaps, the story that you were telling about yourself. But people who start out as either independents or who start out as not registered with a particular political party, we find that moving to a workplace where the co-workers are more Democratic or more Republican tends to make those individuals more Democratic or more Republican, on average.So there is some evidence of a little bit of an effect of the workplace on an individuals’ partisan politics or party affiliation. It’s not as big as in the case of neighborhoods, and so it seems like this channel has less power to explain the segregation that we see.And in particular, the timing of this is kind of interesting. It looks less like the case that people switch to a new workplace and then adopt the politics of that workplace, and rather the case that people update their own party registration and then move to a compatible workplace, a co-partisan workplace. And that’s what kind of leads us to think, like, maybe it’s less the case that people are picking up the politics of their workplace and more the case that people are selecting jobs or workplaces, in part, based on politics or things correlated with their own party affiliation. And that’s the direction that we go in the paper.[Music]Demsas:After the break: how firms use partisan language to appeal to Democratic versus Republican job seekers.[Break]Demsas:What is driving this, I think, is a very useful thing to spend some time on now. I could theorize a bunch of different streams by which partisan sorting shows up, like word of mouth and recommendations, or it might be driven through partisan networks, or Democrats are more likely to be academics, and Republicans are more likely to be petroleum engineers or business owners or whatever. And when you’re able to drill down into how people are sorting, what part of the employment timeline is this actually coming up in?Chinoy:Yeah, that’s right. So it’s not a straightforward answer, in the sense that certainly it’s the case that we can see in our data that Democrats and Republicans are choosing different schools and majors and occupations and industries. And so, clearly, all of that matters. It sort of limits the available workplaces and the kinds of people that you could even possibly interact with at work. That is something we can account for statistically when we measure segregation. I kind of described how we did that earlier, and we still find that there’s residual segregation.So what is explaining that residual? There are a couple of different ideas. And I think the two probably main ones are workers selecting partisan or compatible workplaces, or it’s some kind of employer-discrimination channel, where employers are hiring people of a particular party or want things correlated with a particular partisanship, partisan identity.And we focus on worker selection in this paper, kind of for the reason that I mentioned, that suggestive timing of when people are moving to co-partisan workplaces after sort of updating their party registration. And we focus on the worker-selection channel. And we try to say, you know,Is it the case that workers are actually selecting jobs based on something related to their political identity and something related to how they perceive the politics of the company?We do this in a survey, and sort of the key question, I think, to begin studying this is, you know,What do workers actually know about a company when they choose whether or not to apply for a job there?It could be the case that segregation is driven because Democrats, you know, want to work at companies with more Democrats, but, like, is that something you really know when you apply for a job? You don’t know that it’s 60 percent Democrats versus 40 percent or something like that.And so to study this, we look at our big data set that we’ve assembled of all these companies and shares of Democrats and Republicans who actually work there. And we look at how these companies are signaling. We look at the language that they used to describe themselves, and we see how that correlates with partisanship, with the shares of Democrats and Republicans who are actually at that company. And we actually find that there’s quite a bit of signal here, that the Democratic companies are advertising themselves in a way that’s quite different from the Republican companies, even within the same industry.And a lot of the actual signaling language probably won’t surprise you. It’s words related to the environment and diversity and community for the Democratic companies, and sort of the absence of those for the Republican companies. But the fact that these signals kind of come through so clearly in our data kind of leads us to study the extent to which this can drive sorting. And I’ll pause there for a second, but I can tell you more about that.Demsas:I would like to talk more about that because I saw the ideological signals and company descriptions, and this is on LinkedIn, right? So how are Democratic firms versus Republican firms describing themselves?Chinoy:Yes, exactly. So, again, I want to emphasize this is all within industries. So we’re not just comparing, you know, nonprofits, which tend to have more Democratic employees, to, say, energy companies or oil-and-gas firms, which tend to have more Republican employees. This is saying,Take two firms within the same industry. Look at the text that they use, the words that they use on LinkedIn to describe themselves. And we find empirically that there are these words that are quite correlated with the partisanship of the employees.And again, it’s a lot of the kind of bundle of things related to ESG practices and things related to diversity initiatives and things that are related to more subtle, perhaps, things, like,We’re a company that really emphasizes community and teamwork among our co-workers—that tends to be empirically more Democratic—versus,We’re a company that really emphasizes customer service and efficiency and excellence.That tends to actually be more correlated with companies that have more Republicans, which maybe wasn’t necessarily obvious to me.Demsas:Yeah. I saw this other paper come out recently by Erika Kirgios and her co-authors that looks at whether communicating measurable diversity goals attracts or repels historically marginalized job applicants. It’s a bit orthogonal to the broader conversation, but I think it plays into this part of your paper quite well.They look at whether “adding a measurable goal to a public diversity commitment,” like, instead of, quote, “We care about diversity.” You might say, like,We care about diversity and plan to hire at least one woman or racial minority for every white man we hire.And they look at whether that impacts application rates from women and racial minorities. They find that it increases application likelihood among those groups by 6.5 percent, without sacrificing candidate quality. Interestingly, it’s mostly driven by white women. I’m not even sure that the racial-minority finding is statistically significant, though they do find that it’s positive.I think about this in relation here to whether there are different subgroups that are more motivated to find a job with more of their co-partisans at work and how that changes with racial and gender—different subgroups. I don’t know if you have thoughts on that.Chinoy:Yeah, that’s interesting. There’s a lot of interesting work studying how these kinds of job ads affect who applies. The other big one I alluded to before is about ESG practices. And there’s another case, I think, where you can think of ways to make that, like, verifiable. You could say that this company actually has some particular ESG designation.And I think what is maybe interesting about our survey and our paper is that we actually aren’t signaling anything that is explicitly verifiable. There’s no stamp associated with, you know, a company that is more pro-Democratic or more pro-Republican. And yet, this sort of matters. And yet, job seekers clearly seem to pick up on these things and care about them.Demsas:I think someone listening to this might feel like,Okay, is this just a function of this current moment right now? Like, overt partisan politics in the workplace is much more commonplace in recent years.And this prevailing narrative about, like,Politics shouldn’t be discussed at work. You know,Politics, religion—you know, leave that outside the workplace. That’s kind of an older view of the workplace.When exactly were you conducting this? And do you have any sense of whether or not this is just, like, a 2017–2022 moment?Chinoy:Yeah, it’s a great question. So to answer the question, our LinkedIn data is a snapshot from 2022, and our voter-file data, which we’re kind of using to track how people’s party affiliation changes as they move from workplace to workplace, starts in 2012. And so it’s covering, you know, a more recent time period, for sure.The question of,Can we measure how this is changing over time?I think it is super interesting and a little bit hard, in the sense that you can see in our LinkedIn data, where everyone was working in 2010, but then you worry,Who are the kinds of people who have gone through and listed where they worked in 2010?And so you worry about selection, and so I find that kind of a hard question to answer.I think that there’s suggestive stuff. So, you know, if you ask people in surveys if they’re willing to leave a job over political differences, you’ll find that it’s the case that young people are much more likely to say that. Now, was that true in 1962? I’m not quite sure. But that sort of points in that direction. You find that in other countries—in Brazil, for example—that this kind of political assortative matching has been increasing over time. You find that among corporate boards, again, this kind of thing has been increasing over time.And so I think there are a lot of sort of suggestive indications that this might be something that is more pronounced today than it was a couple of decades ago. It’s really hard to say for sure, though.Demsas:Yeah. It’s funny, too, because part of what’s happened over this time period, at least in the United States, is that our parties have become much more sorted on ideology. And so in the 1950s or whatever, there were a lot more conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans, and that has changed significantly over time. And now most people who are ideologically liberal have sorted into the Democratic Party, so it becomes kind of difficult to measure this if you’re looking at just partisan measurements. Like, maybe there was more partisan diversity at workplaces in 1962, but ideological diversity was still really low, and people were still sorting. So I think there’s quite a difficulty with measurement there.Chinoy:That’s a good point. It makes me sort of think of one other point, which is that for a smaller set of our sample, about 10 percent of our sample, we can measure their donation behavior. And so there, we can actually look at sort of a within-party measure of sorting. We can say,Is it the case that the more liberal Democrats, as measured by who they’re actually donating to, are sorting into workplaces with more Democrats, and vice versa for Republicans?And there, we also find pretty strong patterns. So there is an extent to which this exists even within party.Demsas:Another question I have is about, like, obviously 2022—pretty tight labor market. So workers had tons of choice and ability to sort based on a bunch of different amenities. And I wonder if you think that this kind of sorting happens less in a high-unemployment environment. So, you know, God forbid, when there’s a recession at some point, or there’s a period of high unemployment, do you expect this kind of ideological sorting to go down?Chinoy:Yeah, so I think the answer is yes. And I think that, again, that would be a pretty cool follow-up paper. I think that’s something that we can probably study directly in the data that we have.I think that one piece of evidence here is, you know, how important are these kinds of what we call “ideological amenities” or “partisan amenities”? How much are these characteristics about a job—how much do workers value them, relative to other things that they might care about in a job? Our survey is designed to precisely measure the quantitative trade-offs people would make for these kinds of ideological amenities, you know, trading off against wages. It turns out to be about 3 percent of their salary.Demsas:(Laughs.) That’s wild.Chinoy:Is that big or small? I think it depends on your priors. But, you know, it’s certainly way smaller than what people would pay for health care or, you know, some of these sort of more—Demsas:How do you measure that? How do you know someone’s willing to trade 3 percent of their salary?Chinoy:Yeah. So this is kind of what I was getting at before. We pick up these ideological signals in the way these companies describe themselves. We use them to generate synthetic job ads. We want to ask workers in a wide range of occupations and industries about these different kinds of jobs. How do we do that without me sitting down and writing, you know, 10,000 job ads?This turns out to be exactly the kind of thing that ChatGPT is good at, a large language model is good at. We can give it these kinds of ideological signals that we find, in our data, are correlated with companies with more Democrats and Republicans. We can give it a particular occupation and industry, and it’ll come back with a job ad that does emphasize these signals or doesn’t emphasize these signals, and then we ask workers about them in an online survey.We ask them to explicitly make choices between these companies that are framed in different ways, and we vary the wages associated with these job ads, and that’s how we can sort of capture the strength of this trade-off. And so that’s where we get this 3 percent number. Is it big or small? It’s less than something like health care. It’s sort of actually comparable in magnitude to some of these softer amenities, things like having a relaxed versus a fast pace of work, for example, or having training opportunities at work.People seem to care similarly about the ideological nature of the job. Of course, the difference is that our ideological amenities are precisely designed to split Democrats and Republicans. You know, Democrats care about the liberal one, and Republicans care about the other one. Whereas, Democrats and Republicans care similarly about, say, a relaxed pace of work. And so those other amenities can’t generate segregation, but the stuff that we study and design actually can generate segregation.Demsas:I’m not surprised that people would trade off a little bit on wages in order to feel more comfortable at work with their ideological co-partisans. But I wonder if you were to tell people,Hey—your revealed preference is that you would sacrifice, like, X thousand dollars a year. Do you actually want to take that trade?With remote work, for instance, they’re doing these experiments now where people are like,Yeah, I will take a pay cut in order to be able to be fully remote.I wonder if people would explicitly say,Yes, in order to be at a more Republican firm, I will give you $3,000. I wonder if that’s a self-conception problem that we might run into if you made that explicit.Chinoy:Yeah. So certainly we’re asking people in the survey to kind of make these trade-offs explicitly. You know, it’s job A or job B, and it’s $3,000 or not. I will say, also, that in the observational data, we don’t know individuals’ wages directly.Again, that’s the problem I mentioned. People don’t list their salary in their LinkedIn profile, but we do know something about where they live and their occupation and their industry. We know what college they went to. And so we can take similar Democrats and Republicans—similar in terms of their demographics and where they live, and in terms of what exact college they went to, which is a pretty good measure of education or perhaps labor-market skills—and find that the Democrats are consistently choosing occupations and industries that pay less than the Republicans. And so there’s certainly some evidence, or some suggestive evidence, that there’s some trade-off that people are making between fit with the workplace, or their job more generally, and the actual salary associated with that job.Demsas:There’s Gallup polling from February of last year that asked about U.S. employees’ experience with political conversations at work. And conservatives were much more likely to say that they had a discussion with co-workers about politics: 60 percent of conservatives versus 48 percent of liberals. That is contrary to, at least, my expectations. I’d expect parity, or maybe liberals would be doing it more. I don’t know why I had that expectation, but I was surprised.It makes me think that maybe there’s some sort of mobilization aspect happening here, if conservatives are saying, in 2024, that they’re having conversations with co-workers about politics, and then, all of a sudden, conservatives win a trifecta. I don’t know if that’s playing into it.Chinoy:That’s interesting. That probably goes against my priors a little bit too. I think I would have expected liberals or Democrats to be having more of these conversations at work. That’s interesting.I think that, certainly, studying mobilization—it’s actually not clear to me, right? If you’re part of the majority group at your workplace, and then everyone’s like,Hey, let’s go vote for our guy, for our candidate.Is that actually going to make you more likely to turn out? Or is there some sort of backlash effect if you’re a minority and you say, you know,I really hate all these conversations I’m having with my co-workers. I’m going to go try to vote them out of office, or something like that? It’s not super clear to me what direction that goes in. I think that it is a great question.Demsas:I’m revealing a lot about my psychology in this episode, going, like,Well, if I had 60 percent people who disagreed with me, then I’m definitely gonna go vote, you know? So maybe that’s not the average experience for people. (Laughs.)Chinoy:Well, to tie this back, again, I think we find these, like, pretty heterogeneous effects on partisanship for people who start out as committed, versus not. And so I think there’s some sense in which maybe people who are younger and who are susceptible to political influence might adopt the politics of their workplace and perhaps turn out, and then people who already have a particular ideological stance or particular partisan attachment might be motivated to turn out as a backlash against the prevailing politics of the workplace. I’m not sure. I think that’s an interesting question.Demsas:So we mentioned a couple times—I mean, you’re on the job market right now. You’ve mentioned academia a bit. I mean, have you seen any of this playing out in your own field? Like, this kind of sorting?Chinoy:Yes. And I think that one fascinating thing, I think, is the sorting across college majors, which is something that we can see—sorting across colleges but also across college majors. And we can see this explicitly in our data. It turns out that economics is pretty much in the middle, which, when I tell economists, makes them very happy that it’s a discipline that doesn’t necessarily lean so far one way or another.But certainly, higher education leans to the left in our data. Certainly, elite colleges lean to the left in our data. Certainly, many academic disciplines lean to the left in our data. And so I guess for lack of a more sophisticated answer, if you’re looking for a place with a good deal of partisan segregation, looking at universities is not a bad place to look.Demsas:The mechanisms are interesting because you have this self-sorting. You lean a lot on people choosing these sorts of majors that are kind of correlated with their partisan identities or may help shape their partisan identities. And then they choose workplaces and things like that, and colleges, and down the line, etcetera.But is there any impact that you can find on the employer side of selection? Like, I don’t know if you’re experiencing this at all, too, but there’s some level to which, when you’re in a job interview, they’re trying to suss out if you’re a good fit for the company. And part of that fit, I assume, might be ideological or partisan.Chinoy:I think that’s absolutely right. And so I think that just isn’t the main mechanism or the main channel that we study in this paper, honestly, because we have to choose something. And so we focus on the worker side. Again, there’s evidence—from Brazil, in particular, there’s a paper looking at employer, you could call it, discrimination. There are audit studies in the U.S. looking at callback rates for résumés that signal whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, and there’s some evidence for that as well. So yes, I do think that kind of employer-selection story is certainly part of what’s going on.Demsas:I think your focus on the employee side is actually really interesting, because I think it raises questions about allowing this kind of free choice, how that can lead to, maybe, societally suboptimal ends. There’s a new paper in theAmerican Political Science Reviewfrom Jon Green and several of his co-authors that looks at demand for echo chambers.And we think about echo chambers, and we’re like,Oh man, social media. It’s such an echo chamber.We’re talking about it as if it’s kind of imposed on us. And their intro of that paper has something interesting. They argue that “networked curation processes lead information consumption on social media in particular to be more politically homogeneous than [this] empirical literature has thus far suggested. However, this is more areflectionof democracy than athreatto democracy—a product of individuals engaging with information, and each other, on their own terms.”Essentially, people are choosing to follow certain people. They follow creators. They follow influencers. They follow their friends. They follow people that make them feel good about themselves. There was this big outrage recently. I don’t know if you noticed—people were following the VP account on Instagram and then were shocked to realize that they were now following J. D. Vance, and now a mass unfollowing happened. And it’s like, you had curated your Instagram feed to be people you wanted to follow, and all of a sudden you see, like, J. D. Vance being inaugurated on your feed, and you’re like,How did I get on here? What’s going on?And it’s an interesting question about—in previous generations, people went and they bought a newspaper, and you couldn’t just choose to take the parts of the newspaper that you wanted. You had to take it all. And you don’t do that anymore. So I don’t know if you have thoughts on that. Or should you want to change this, are there even ways to change this?Chinoy:Yeah. I think that’s a really good point and interesting question:Is partisan segregation bad? Should we be worried about it?I think it is a very important, interesting question.I will note that when labor economists study racial and gender segregation at work, they have a different set of motivations in mind. They have equity motivations in mind. These are protected categories. We really are worried, in particular, about differences in pay between groups doing the same work, whereas I don’t think we have the same equity motivations for being worried about Democrats and Republicans at different workplaces.Demsas:DEI for conservatives in the academy is a very controversial conversation. (Laughs.)Chinoy:Exactly. Yeah. So without going there, I think that we have different motivations to study partisan segregation at work versus these other forms of segregation.I think that—and this is kind of getting to a conversation that we had a little bit earlier—it’s probably good that people get to do what they want and put themselves in workplaces where they feel happy and where the organization kind of aligns with their goals. It’s probably good that people work with co-workers who they get along with. It probably makes them, to some extent, more productive. Does it make the actual firms more or less productive? I think that is an open question, and certainly one that factors into this calculus about whether we think this is ultimately helpful or harmful.And then, of course, I think the other really hard question to answer, which we talked about before, is: What does this do for democracy generally? Should we think that it’s bad that this place where we thought that partisans might be mixing more than other environments actually isn’t going to provide that kind of kind of mixing? What are, exactly, the consequences of that lack of contact between people who don’t think the same way? I think it is a hard question to nail down. I think we have this intuitive sense that probably it’s not so good if we really segregate ourselves politically. But actually quantifying or measuring and thinking about,What are the effects of that?I think is still an open question.Demsas:One note of hope I might relay here is that—I thought about this in the context of my job, which is, obviously, not the average job in the United States, but I come into contact, in the context of my work, with people who don’t work here, all the time.So for instance, I might come into contact with people who I’m interviewing, who are different from me, when I’m walking down the street, doing man-on-the-street interviews. But if I also conceptualize other jobs—if you’re in the service industry and you’re a restaurant worker, maybe all your co-workers behind the bar are on the same team as you, but you’re serving customers and talking to them and interacting with them, and that may also lead to a lot of that cross-partisan contact.I think it’s both difficult—impossible, maybe even—and undesirable from a business perspective to be able to even do that sorting. Obviously, at some level, businesses do this, right? Like, if you have a rainbow flag in the window or something, you’re signaling to people. But, you know, in general, most jobs force you to interact with people outside of your workplace. And that sorting may happen much less in that context. So you could think of, like, your workplace as your home, versus, you know, when you go outside, and then you’re like,Okay, well, I’m interacting with people who are different than me, but I have a place to go back and, you know, dish with my co-workers about how rude they were.Chinoy:Yeah, so I think that studying the extent to which different occupations interact with customers or with the public and whether that sort of has some bearing on these effects on political views, I think would also be interesting. When they say the workplace is a context for this kind of cross-cutting discourse, I think what they usually have in mind is, like, with fellow co-workers. But certainly, you’re right that those aren’t the only people that you interact with in the context of work. And so that would be super cool to study.Demsas:Well, that’s a great place for, I think, our final question, which is: What is an idea that you once thought was a great one but ended up only being good on paper?Chinoy:So I thought about this a bit, and if you’ll forgive me, I think I’m going to mention another academic paper, which is related but not exactly the same. So one thing that I’m super interested in, as someone who’s interested in politics and demographics and data, is the extent to which these demographic characteristics, some of which we’ve been talking about, are really predictive of politics and party affiliation and things like race and gender and age.And I think what is tempting, then, is to say,There are these strong correlations that exist between politics and demographics. We know something usually about demographic trends in the U.S., whether a particular racial group is growing, whether people are becoming more educated, on average, or not. And so using that to make predictions about what’s going to happen to politics and to elections, I think, is really tempting.This is the idea that, you know, people are becoming more educated, on average, and more-educated people tend to vote for Democrats, and so the Democrats are going to do better in the future. There are various versions of this argument, and it’s quite tempting to make, but it turns out it doesn’t really work.There’s a paper by one of my advisors, Vincent Pons, as well as Jesse Shapiro and Richard Calvo where they test this. So they look at the correlation between politics and demographics in a particular election. They say,If these correlations were the same in the next election and we sort of just tracked the evolution of demographics from election to election, how good would that prediction be?And it turns out that it’s quite bad. It’s sort of worse than just guessing that it’s gonna be 50–50, Democrat or Republican.And I think that sort of goes to show that—it’s kind of interesting that these demographic correlations are so strong in the moment. But also, these trends are kind of slow moving, and politics responds kind of quickly, and parties respond to where they see their electoral advantages.Demsas:Demographics are not destiny.Chinoy:Yeah, I could have just said that, and I think I probably would have gotten the same point across. But this is a longer way of saying that.Demsas:No, it’s great. We’ll put the papers in the show notes as well. But thank you so much, Sahil. This was fantastic.Chinoy:Thanks for your time.[Music]Demsas:Good on Paperis produced by Rosie Hughes. It was edited by Dave Shaw, fact-checked by Ena Alvarado, and engineered by Erica Huang.

How AI Startups Can Invest in Carbon Reduction Strategies,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Smartdatacollective.com'}",https://www.smartdatacollective.com/how-ai-startups-can-invest-in-carbon-reduction-strategies/,"SmartData Collective>Business Intelligence>Artificial Intelligence>How AI Startups Can Invest in Carbon Reduction StrategiesArtificial IntelligenceExclusiveHow AI Startups Can Invest in Carbon Reduction StrategiesAI startups can become more sustainable by investing in carbon reduction strategies that benefit both business and the planet.Alexandra Bohigian8 Min ReadAI-Generated Image from Google LabsSHAREWe have talked about a lot of the upsides of AI, but there are some downsides too. We mentioned that there arestill jobs humans do better than AI. But there are also issues with climate change that AI has caused.ContentsWhy You Should Invest in Carbon Reduction StrategiesLower energy and operational costsIncreased investor confidence and access to capitalCompetitive advantage and brand reputationMitigation of regulatory and legal risksResilience and optimization of supply chain costConclusionWhilebig data can help the planet, it can also create climate change problems. AI is increasingly becoming a major contributor to the global carbon footprint. In an article published by Melissa Heikkilä for MIT Technology Review, she highlights the growing environmental concerns surrounding the energy consumption of AI technologies, particularly large machine learning models.“But there’s one thing people aren’t talking enough about, and that’s the carbon footprint of AI. One part of the reason is that big tech companies don’t share the carbon footprint of training and using their massive models, and we don’t have standardized ways of measuring the emissions AI is responsible for. And while we know training AI models is highly polluting, the emissions attributable to using AI have been a missing piece so far. That is, until now,” Heikkiläwrites.Training these models requires vast amounts of computational power, which in turn demands energy from data centers that often rely on fossil fuels. As AI adoption accelerates across industries, the environmental impact continues to grow, with the need for more powerful algorithms and larger datasets driving up electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This puts the onus on AI startups to address this issue and find ways to minimize the carbon footprint associated with their innovations.More ReadUnderstanding the Tremendous Benefits of IoT for Small Businesses10 Best Practices For Business Intelligence DashboardsThe Top 7 Data Analytics Tools for 2019Data Analytics Play Huge Role In Optimizing Organization ManagementHow Public Opinion Shapes the Future of AIIn addition to this concern, major tech companies are seeing their emissions rise despite efforts to reduce them. Google, for example, reported that its greenhouse gas emissionsincreased by 48% from 2019 to 2024, largely driven by the energy-intensive nature of its AI operations. As AI continues to grow in complexity and use, startups in the sector must take proactive steps to counterbalance their environmental impact. By integrating carbon reduction strategies, adopting renewable energy sources, and developing more energy-efficient AI models, these companies can not only help combat climate change but also lead the way in making the tech industry more sustainable.Companies increasingly see the global economy’s switch towards sustainability as an environmental obligation and an opportunity for business gain.The cost savings, new revenue opportunities, and market competitiveness they can bring are significant enough to reduce carbon emissions.This article discusses the financial benefits of carbon reduction strategies and why companies should focus on sustainability in their business models.Why You Should Invest in Carbon Reduction StrategiesCarbon reduction strategies were perceived as entirely benefiting the environment until other discoveries were made. The following are some financial benefits associated with using carbon reduction strategies.Lower energy and operational costsOne of the most immediate financial benefits of carbon reduction is the reduction in energy costs. Energy efficiency in moving energy from the atmosphere to fluids in a machine or from fluid to fluid is of ultimate importance.Investing in upgrades from incandescent bulbs to LEDs, optimizing heating and cooling systems, or switching to renewable energy sources can reduce electricity bills.Investing in solar and wind power saves money by reducing the volatility of fossil fuel prices and ensuring that the investments are paid for upfront.Adding green fuel can reduce fuel and maintenance costs relative to gasoline or diesel vehicles.For businesses to save money while investing in a cleaner environment means using less energy and replacing the bad with the good.Increased investor confidence and access to capitalThe environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are increasingly becoming a priority in investors’ financial decisions. Meanwhile, ESG offers several benefits to companies.Companies with well-established carbon reduction strategies are more desirable, too.Modern institutional investors and ESG funds have invested billions of dollars in sustainable businesses.Businesses with strong sustainability practices have lower risks and better long-term financial performance, so stock market investors prefer investing in such entities.Companies that demonstrate a commitment to carbon reduction improve their reputations and make it easier to access capital markets.Competitive advantage and brand reputationMany industries have made sustainability a key differentiator. Consumers, employees, and business partners prefer companies that regard environmental responsibility as an essential issue. Benefits include:Sustainable brands with more customer loyalty because they tend to appeal to eco-conscious customers.Increased trust and credibility increase the brand’s reputation in the marketplace.Top talent, as job seekers, especially younger professionals, prefer working for companies that reflect their values by attracting them.Businesses can also make carbon reduction work for them by ensuring that it becomes part of corporate strategy, thereby enhancing their short- and long-term competitive position.Mitigation of regulatory and legal risksCarbon emission regulations are getting tighter all around the world. Companies that do not adhere to new environmental laws will:Get fines and penalties for breaking the carbon limit.Higher carbon taxes and emission fees bring about higher operational costs.Reputational damage from lawsuits and negative media coverage.By reducing carbon emissions before these regulations take effect, businesses can stay ahead of the curve, avoid financial risks, and operate more stably.Resilience and optimization of supply chain costSustainable supply chain practices can reduce costs significantly. Therefore, businesses can use those prioritizing carbon reduction in their supply chains.Realizing the circular economy concept through recycling and reusing materials lowers material costs.Reduced fuel consumption by optimizing logistics and transportation that could improve efficiency.Less dependence on fossil fuels and therefore less risk with constant prices and disruptions of fossil fuel supply chain.Not only does a low-carbon supply chain further reduce costs, but it also helps strengthen relationships with clients and partners who care about sustainability.ConclusionInvesting in carbon reduction strategies is not about environmental responsibility but being financially wise. In all,ambitious Scope 3 reduction targetsare the new way to help reduce greenhouse emissions. It focuses on the indirect emissions generated by suppliers.

Thai long-term equity funds to be revived soon,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Bangkok Post'}",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/investment/2958898/thai-long-term-equity-funds-to-be-revived-soon,"BusinessInvestmentThai long-term equity funds to be revived soonFinance minister urges holders of existing LTF units not to sellPUBLISHED : 11 Feb 2025 at 15:21WRITER:Reuters and Online ReportersSmallMediumLarge191Listen to this articlePlayPauseThe Thai government plans to revive the long-term equity fund (LTF) programme to support the local stock market, which has been the worst performer in Asia so far this year.The fund could be set up within the existing environmental, social and governance fund (ESG) framework and investors would receive similar tax breaks for five years, Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira told reporters on Tuesday.The fund is expected to help slow down selling from long-term funds, which has added pressure to the market, he said, adding that details were expected to be announced soon.The Stock Exchange of Thailand index was up 0.5% on Tuesday but has still dropped about 9% since the start of the year.With the new fund, “investors who want to sell will stop and think whether to sell or not because if they are in the ESG fund, they will also receive tax benefits”, Mr Pichai said.The original LTF programme that ran until 2019 was popular with investors. In order to enjoy tax savings, investors had to hold their units for seven calendar years. The last LTF units that were purchased in 2019, totalling an estimated 188 billion baht, are maturing this year and next.Many investors have been selling their units due to stock market losses, with the majority of LTF holdings being in large-cap stocks, Mr Pichai said.Former prime ministerThaksin Shinawatra saidrecently that LTFs are more effective at stimulating market activity than Thai ESG funds.CGS International Securities has estimated that 43 billion baht worth of LTF units were redeemed in 2024, bringing the value of units outstanding to 220 billion baht at the end of 2024.Without new LTF inflows, the brokerage estimated LTF redemption of 45 billion baht this year and 40 billion in 2026.4KEYWORDSLTFLong-term equity fundsThai ESG fundStock Exchange of ThailandDo you like the content of this article?COMMENT(1)"

Central to these efforts are strategies like carbon capture, afforestation and the innovative use of fast-growing tree species such as paulownia. While the United Kingdom leads as part of the G7 in setting legally binding net-zero targets and implementing government-backed initiatives to increase afforestation efforts, the opportunities tied to achieving net zero are truly global.For business leaders, afforestation and carbon capture are not just about environmental responsibility—they are strategic tools to meet investor and consumer expectations and secure a competitive edge in an increasingly sustainability-focused economy.Having worked on afforestation and carbon offset projects, I’ve seen how businesses can use them for both impact and growth. Investing in afforestation or integrating carbon capture helps companies align with net-zero goals while unlocking new revenue streams.The Global Role Of Afforestation In Net-Zero EffortsAfforestation, the process of planting trees in previously non-forested areas, remains one of the most effective strategies for capturing carbon dioxide. Trees act as natural carbon sinks, pulling CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it in their biomass and surrounding soil. Globally, afforestation efforts not only contribute to climate mitigation but also enhance biodiversity, improve water cycles and restore degraded lands.Countries around the world, including China, India, Brazil and members of the EU, are setting significant afforestation targets. For instance, China’sGreen Great Wall initiativehas seen millions of hectares reforested, contributing to reduced desertification and increased carbon sequestration. Similarly, the U.K.aims to increaseits forest coverage from 13% to 17% by 2050. This would involve planting around 30,000 hectares of new woodland annually to help achieve net-zero carbon emissions. These initiatives reflect significant national commitments to afforestation as a strategy for environmental restoration and carbon sequestration.Private sector involvement is crucial to scaling these efforts. Businesses have a unique opportunity to invest in afforestation projects as part of their sustainability strategies, offsetting their emissions while contributing to global environmental goals.Paulownia Trees: A Game-Changer In Carbon CapturePaulownia trees, known for their exceptional growth rates, are gaining attention as a pivotal component in afforestation and carbon capture strategies. Native to Asia, these trees can grow up to 15 feet in their first year and reach maturity in just 7-10 years, making them highly effective at sequestering carbon dioxide.Beyond their environmental benefits, paulownia trees are valued for their lightweight and durable wood, which can be used in construction, furniture and biofuels, creating opportunities for circular economies. Additionally, their deep root systems restore soil quality, making them ideal for degraded lands in need of regeneration.The global adoption of paulownia trees offers a scalable and sustainable solution to address carbon emissions while providing economic benefits to communities and businesses.Despite their benefits, paulownia trees must be carefully managed, as some species have been classified as invasive in certain regions. Businesses looking to incorporate paulownia into afforestation projects should work with forestry experts and adhere to local environmental regulations to ensure responsible planting and prevent ecological disruption.Carbon Offsetting: A Global Business ImperativeCarbon offsetting is becoming a cornerstone of corporate sustainability strategies worldwide. While reducing emissions remains a priority, offsetting provides a practical way to address residual emissions. Afforestation projects are particularly impactful, offering measurable carbon reductions alongside broader environmental and social benefits.For global businesses, investing in carbon offsets aligns with consumer and investor demands for sustainability. Transparency is key—companies must ensure their offsetting initiatives are verified by credible organizations and communicate their efforts authentically to build trust and credibility.Embracing AfforestationFrom multinational corporations to SMEs, companies can support afforestation projects in diverse ways, including direct investments, partnerships with environmental organizations or purchasing verified carbon credits.Countries such as the U.S., Germany and Australia offer attractive opportunities for businesses to engage in afforestation initiatives through government programs and public-private partnerships. In the U.K., businesses benefit from grants and incentives that support sustainable forestry projects, further driving private-sector engagement.Afforestation also aligns with the growing importance of ESG criteria. Companies actively participating in carbon capture and biodiversity enhancement are better positioned to attract investors and customers who prioritize sustainability.Overcoming Challenges In AfforestationWhile afforestation presents immense potential, it is not without challenges. Globally, issues such as land availability, regulatory hurdles and long-term project management can hinder progress. For example, balancing land use for agriculture, housing and forestry requires careful planning.Businesses can navigate these challenges by collaborating with forestry experts, engaging local communities and adopting innovative land-use strategies. Leveraging technology, such as satellite monitoring and data analytics, can also improve project management and transparency.How To Get Started• Assess your carbon footprint:Begin by identifying the volume of emissions that need to be offset and focus on reducing emissions wherever possible. Companies can determine their carbon footprint through carbon accounting tools such as the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, corporate sustainability reports or third-party assessments. Common ways to reduce emissions include optimizing energy efficiency, switching to renewable energy sources and reducing waste in supply chains.• Partner globally:Collaborate with international afforestation initiatives or invest in projects in regions with the highest carbon offset potential.• Incorporate innovation:Use technology to monitor afforestation efforts, ensuring transparency and maximizing the impact of your investments. Remote sensing via satellites, AI-driven forest monitoring systems and blockchain-based carbon credit tracking are some of the emerging technologies that help businesses track afforestation efforts more effectively.• Engage stakeholders:Share your efforts with employees, customers and investors to strengthen relationships and accountability.Companies can play a pivotal role in achieving net-zero targets. Businesses that prioritize these efforts will position themselves as forward-thinking leaders. As the global push for sustainability accelerates, the companies that act now will inspire others and secure their place in the future economy.Forbes Business Development Councilis an invitation-only community for sales and biz dev executives.Do I qualify?Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"
Building (And Renovating) for the Future: Lessons from Another Year of ESG,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Hospitality Net'}",https://www.hospitalitynet.org/opinion/4125767.html,"OpinionEnvironment & SustainabilityBuilding (And Renovating) for the Future: Lessons from Another Year of ESGByPaul   McElroyExecutive Vice President, Highgate13 February 2025At the recently opened Romer House Waikiki, Highgate became the first large hotel owner and manager to complete a green concrete project.
 — Photo by Highgate Hotels, L.P.At the end of last year, Highgate Hotels reached our goal to have 150 third-party eco-certified hotels by 2024. We also published our latest environmental and social governance (ESG) report, which details forward-thinking initiatives involving green concrete, reforestation and regenerative agriculture, and using leftover cooking oil for sustainable aviation fuel production.We’ve installed more than 165 electric vehicle charging stations, installed thousands of solar panels (which have generated nearly 3.5 million kWh of renewable energy), invested in offsite wind and solar energy, and planted tens of thousands of trees.We are certainly proud of all the time, work, collaboration and innovation that goes into our industry-leading ESG efforts. But 2024 also had its challenges–and, in the aftermath of the 2023 Maui wildfires, it was also the year our ESG efforts became more personal than ever. My office is located in Honolulu, and Highgate operates 16 hotels across the Hawaiian islands. Our Royal Lahaina Resort was the first hotel to open its doors to displaced residents after the fires (which were greatly exacerbated by abnormally dry, hot weather).Given economic uncertainties, 2024 was also a reminder that important ESG work comes in all forms. Sometimes important progress comes thanks to smaller, cost-conscious programs; other times, we get the opportunity to pilot big, ambitious sustainability initiatives. ESG is a complex, always-changing undertaking that requires a mix of tactics and an ability to adapt to changing conditions. My team and I learned many lessons about responsibly building, renovating and operating hotels over the last 12 months; here are some highlights.At the Twin Fin Hotel in Waikīkī, Highgate partnered with Remanufacturing and Design Group to refurbish existing dressers, nightstands and bathroom vanities.

 — Photo by Highgate Hotels, L.P.The Cost-Impact JuggleAn unpredictable economy has become our industry’s new normal over the last half decade. While builders, developers, owners and operators are always mindful of costs, today’s hotel projects are exceedingly cost-conscious, regardless of scale or hotel class. And that means some of our grander ideas for building or renovating in a responsible way simply won’t be approved because they require significantly more capital than the traditional way of doing things, often labeled the “green premium”.In a perfect world, every project we embark on would fully prioritize stewardship of the earth and all its inhabitants. But I also understand the terrific economic pressures impacting every part of our business. So, until sustainable products and materials are cost neutral, we’ll need to continue looking for cost-effective ways to reduce our environmental impact. For example, for every large-scale renovation project, we now ask contractors to share their waste-management plans as part of the RFP process; we will be incorporating this practice into every RFP moving forward. Often we’ll be able to divert waste in creative and less-expensive ways–like recycling bathroom fixtures or donating furniture to local nonprofit organizations. Or, if a project’s waste management plan adds to the total cost, we’ll be able to plan ahead for proper reuse and recycling.Through simple operational adjustments like installing low-flow shower heads and LED light bulbs, we’ve achieved measurable sustainability gains with little to no green premium. We’ve implemented smart technology to automate and streamline temperature control at several hotels, worked to eliminate single-use plastics, and we now only offer reef-safe sunscreen at all Highgate’s Hawaii and Key West properties. At the Westin Las Vegas and other full-service properties, the installation of water bottle refill stations has reduced plastic consumption and increased socialization in the lobby.While scaling back might feel disappointing, we know that impact doesn’t always need to come from grand gestures. So we stay committed to consistently measuring and reducing our impact, finding new ways to do more with less, and making decisions that balance financial responsibility and environmental stewardship. Greening your business doesn’t always need to be a visible, high-profile effort—it just needs to be effective. And sometimes effectiveness means focusing on the actions that make sense both environmentally and financially.Go Big When You Canith that said, sometimes a new build or a large-scale renovation presents an opportunity to pilot new and ambitious ESG strategies. While it’s true that some of these solutions come at a higher initial cost, they often pay dividends in the long run. And hotel construction is at an all-time high, which means hospitality companies across the world will have more opportunities to incorporate cutting-edge technologies and tactics.At the recently opened Romer House Waikīkī, for example, we became the first large hotel owner and manager to complete a green concrete project. We utilizedCarbonCure’s cutting-edge technology to inject captured carbon dioxide into fresh concrete while it was being mixed. This practice maintains the concrete’s compressive strength and can enable reductions of carbon-intensive cement. On average, CarbonCure helps concrete producers reduce between 15 and 25 pounds of carbon dioxide per cubic yard of ready-mix concrete. (A standard high-rise commercial structure built with CarbonCure concrete would save 680 metric tons of carbon dioxide, which is equivalent to the annual carbon sequestration capacity of 889 acres of forest.)This technology decreased the hotel’s embodied carbon emissions; it also sets a clear example for the rest of the industry. And it’s an important issue:According toESG benchmark organization GRESB, the built environment is responsible for 42 percent of annual GHG emissions, with 15 percent of that figure coming from building materials and construction processes.Another big, bold project recently debuted just down the road, at the Twin Fin Hotel in Waikīkī. Instead of purchasing new guest-room furniture, we partnered withRemanufacturing and Design Groupto refurbish existing dressers, nightstands and bathroom vanities. We also partnered with nonprofit organizationParley for the Oceansto create a striking oversized lobby sculpture made from waste collected from oceans.Not every project can be a Twin Fin. But when we get an opportunity to apply learnings from that ambitious project (or, as we call it, “Twin Fin-ification”), we take it gladly. We’re still measuring the impact of both these projects and will continue replicating their successes. In fact, we’re currently building Twin-Fin-inspired model rooms at three hotels across Highgate’s portfolio that will be adopting a similar approach. These model rooms showcase the innovation, beauty and vast potential of rehabbing furniture rather than throwing everything away and starting from scratch.Highgate partnered with Green Standards to responsibly remove used furniture and materials during a renovation of the M Social Hotel in NYC, reducing carbon emissions.

 — Photo by Highgate Hotels, L.P.Resilience is the New StandardClimate change is, quite literally, at our front door–so the urgency to build and renovate responsibly is one we take very seriously. Highgate owns and operates properties on beachfronts and in the path of devastating storms. We’re also working to renovate hotels in ski areas that, for the first time in their history, are finding themselves in need of air conditioning in order to remain open through the summer months. On Florida’s Gulf Coast, the Highgate-managed TradeWinds resort was hit by back-to-back Hurricanes Helene and Milton (the resort has since fully recovered and resumed normal operations).These harsh realities mean we’re thinking not just about reducing our environmental impact–but also about how we can future-proof our buildings to better withstand extreme weather. While building for resilience has taken on new urgency, the materials we often rely on to build resilient structures (like concrete and steel) can also be some of the most carbon intensive. That means innovative solutions like CarbonCure are absolutely vital for building safe, healthy, future-proof buildings. But we’re not just weatherproofing hotels; we’re working to create long-term solutions that, eventually, will reduce operational spending–even if that means higher up-front construction costs.Collaborate, Innovate, RepeatOur ESG journey is just that: a journey. And we can’t do it alone. One of the most valuable lessons we’ve learned is the importance of collaboration with our suppliers, contractors and an increasing number of ESG partners. We also work with others in the hospitality industry to share best practices (i.e., through our involvement with Sharing best practices through our involvement with AHLA’s Sustainability Committee and the World Sustainable Hospitality Alliance).Our partnership with data and analytics companyMindClick, for example, is focused on eliminating chemicals of concern and optimizing our supply chain. We completed seven projects in partnership with MindClick (for a total value of more than $385 million), with an eighth scheduled for completion this spring. That partnership has helped measure our impact, track improvements and identify areas for improvement. And those insights have helped us make steady, meaningful steps forward in both sustainability and operational efficiency.In New York City, we partnered withGreen Standardsto responsibly remove used furniture, fixtures and equipment from a renovation of the M Social Hotel. This partnership successfully decommissioned eight tons of chairs, lamps, curtains and headboard covers, resulting in more than $10,000 worth of donations to local nonprofit organizations like Habitat for Humanity. The initiative also diverted 97.6 percent of waste from landfills and reduced carbon emissions by nearly 300 tons.New, forward-thinking partnerships like these are helping Highgate achieve ambitious ESG goals. But they’re also helping set the tone for collaborations with our existing partners. We’re seeing increasing support from suppliers and contractors who are willing to try new, more sustainable approaches in order to continue working with us.Some of our contractors initially hesitated when we started requiring more sustainable materials and waste-management practices. But over time they’ve embraced this new way of doing business and even started seeing the benefits. It’s a reminder that even in an industry as large and complex as hospitality, we can lead by example and create positive change.Reprinted from the Hotel Business Review with permission fromwww.HotelExecutive.comEnvironment & SustainabilityDesign and ArchitecturePaul   McElroyExecutive Vice President, HighgateHighgate Hotels, L.P.Hotel GroupYour content on Hospitality Net?Hospitality Net membership explained"

[+]State University College of LawFlorida State University College of LawFormer United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights Mary Robinson addressed 800 students and alumni at Florida State University College of Law on February 12 as part of a speaker series on international human rights. The speech covered an array of topics, from the wars in Ukraine and Gaza to climate change, under the umbrella of the rule of law.The D’Alemberte & Palmer Lecture in International Human Rightsis a new series at FSU College of Law, “established to educate the community about the critical field of international human rights, inspire FSU Law students, and contribute to the global discussion on human rights issues.”Robinson was the third speaker in the series, and arguably the most notable. Following a career in national politics, Robinson was elected as the seventh President of Ireland in 1990. She served in the post until she resigned to accept an appointment by UN Secreatary-General Kofi Annan as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in 1997. She served in the position until 2002. In 2014 and in 2016, she was appointed, in different capacities, as a UN Special Envoy for Climate Change.In 2007, Robinson and a group in international leaders including Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu founded The Elders, a small group of “independent global leaders working together for peace, justice, human rights and a sustainable planet.” Tutu served as the first chair of the group, to be replaced by Annan in 2013.

Landau is an international expert in constitutional design, constitutional theory, and comparative constitutional law. In 2022, he was involved in Chile’s constitution-making process through a Fulbright specialist grant.In a prepared speech, Robinson addressed “The Rule of Law in International Human Rights.” A Q&A followed with Professor Darby Kerrigan Scott, the Middle Road Foundation Professor and Co-Director of the Public Interest Law Center at FSU College of Law.The Rule Of LawThe rule of law is a concept, often repeated in legal circles, that has come into recent focus within the political debate in the U.S. over the actions of former President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump. It addresses a nation’s relationship with the applicability and enforcement of laws.The UN defines the rule of lawas “a principle of governance in which all persons, institutions and entities, public and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards.”The rule of law reaches into multiple areas of politics and international policy. In 2022, I spoke on the topic as it relates to judicial independence at the American Bar Association’s International Law Conference alongside Bob Bauer, President Obama’s White House Counsel, and Leah Wortham, Professor Emerita at Columbus School of Law and project reporter for the European Law Institute’sELI-Mount Scopus European Standards of Judicial Independence. Robinson addressed the complicated issue through the lens of international human rights.“I actually feel saddened and dismayed to be giving this lecture at a time when the United States, which used to champion the rule of law, is undermining it both domestically and internationally.”Mary RobinsonIn her opening comment, Robinson took issue with the state of the rule of law in the U.S., stating “I actually feel saddened and dismayed to be giving this lecture at a time when the United States, which used to champion the rule of law, is undermining it both domestically and internationally.” Her disagreements with the Trump administration filtered through her speech.Further, she stated that“advancing respect for the rule of law is an ongoing task and a shared responsibility that remains crucial today, perhaps more so than at any other point in our lifetimes. And this is for two main reasons. First, because we face multiple global crises, where established as well as still emerging legal standards and institutions are critical to collective responses… Second… because living up to the tenets of this principle is a prerequisite for healing divided societies, rebuilding a fractured world order, and forging consensus on how to bring about human security for all.”Pointing to a 2023 World Justice Report, Robinson noted that over 6 billion people live in a country where the rule of law had weakened since the prior year. She also noted that over the past decade, civic participation fell globally by 83%, freedom of assembly by 81%, and freedom of expression by 78%.The Rule Of Law And Human RightsThe application of the rule of law to human rights is most notably seen in times of war. As the UN Commissioner on Human Rights during the Sept. 11, 2001 attack on the U.S., Robinson took issue with international actions by the U.S. at the time, stating,“I was asked, sometimes honestly, but often for more cynical purposes, whether new threats to human security and public order, from terrorist groups to mass migration, from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to climate change, could adequately be confronted without rethinking or putting aside rule of law norms and practices. At the time, my UN colleagues and I stressed that it was precisely such dangers, and the changing, more interconnected world that we line in, that made strengthening respect for rule of law so important.”“...the view that governments will ultimately only rule by power and in their own interest, rather than by law an in accordance with international standards, has taken on additional force.”Mary RobinsonShe noted that, in May 2002, the U.S. withdrew from the Rome Statute, an international treaty that established the International Criminal Court. Then, in 2003, the U.S. and allies invaded Iraq without authorization of the UN Security Council.Notably, the U.S. exit from the Rome Statute has come back into focus following the ICC’s issuance of an arrest warrant for Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and subsequent condemnation of the action by both the Biden and Trump administrations.Looking at more recent times, Robinson states “the view that governments will ultimately only rule by power and in their own interest, rather than by law an in accordance with international standards, has taken on additional force.” She cites the 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Russia as an example. She also looked to the 2023 Hamas attacks in Israel and the subsequent response in Gaza, stating “…the scale of human suffering is intolerable and death tolls have reached shocking levels.”The 2024 advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice, Legal Consequences arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, was also addressed by Robinson.“The recent advisory opinion… alongside a separate case brought by South Africa alleging that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, was a landmark. As legal commentators have noted, the content of the opinion was not unexpected. The court essentially reconfirmed established international law by concluding that all these territories are under Israeli occupation and that the ongoing occupation is unlawful and should be brought to an end as rapidly as possible.”However, Robinson claims the ICJ opinion, and subsequent UN action, is insufficient and inaction is causing damage to the rule of law.“We must acknowledge that the lack of effective actions over a long period to help resolve this conflict, and bring an end to Israel’s offensive in Gaza, has fed perceptions of Western hypocrisy concerning the law and consistent implementation of international law.""This real sense of double standards has been even more damaging in creating a permission structure for leaders wishing to undermine or disregard their own country’s human rights commitments, as well as their legal obligations in a range of other areas from trade to climate change to arms control.”The Rule Of Law And Climate ChangeThe interplay between the rule of law and climate change is often most visible in the legal treatment and protections for climate change protesters. Arrests of Greta Thunberg and other youth activists are often decried as unlawful and vindictive by supporters. There is also a broader question as to the role of youth in the debate.“The continued rise in climate change litigation is also encouraging as citizens assert their rights and hold governments and corporations to account via the courts.”Mary RobinsonThe 2024 UN Summit on the Future, a reaffirmation of the 2015 UN Sustainability Development Goals, addressed the topic of youth, including a declaration for future generations. As noted by Robinson, SDG goal 16 addresses the rule of law, incorporating the topic into the broader sustainability discussion.“Over recent years, we’ve seen how a rights oriented understanding of the rule of law has informed the development of international environmental law, including climate change law.”However, the role of the rule of law is not limited to criminal prosecution, but is also a tool to be used by climate activists who access the court system to impact change. Robinson stated, “the continued rise in climate change litigation is also encouraging as citizens assert their rights and hold governments and corporations to account via the courts.” The use of the Courts to impact change is most notable in recent actions to establish protections against the impact of climate change as a human right.Climate Change As A Human RightA comparatively new concept emerging in international and national law directly links human rights to climate change. Specifically, creating a new human right that protects vulnerable populations from the adverse impacts of climate change and establishes a right to a healthy environment. While some progress in this area has been made through the legislative process, the largest steps have come through international courts. Robinson stated,“There’s still much to be done. It has been greatly encouraging to see that more than a hundred states have recognized the right to a healthy environment at the national level. through constitutional or legislative provisions. And that this right has now been recognized internationally and incorporated into numerous regional human rights agreements and environmental treaties.""But as experts point out, while these developments are positive, environmental rights are young. We must do more to make the case for this broader perspective and build the evidence base for how incorporating environmental rights into national systems shapes substantive outcomes.""Robinson cited the recent case before the European Court of Human Rights that found a legal obligation for the protection against the effects of climate change exists in the European Convention of Human Rights. The case, limited in scope, addressed the concerns and rights of pensioners in Switzerland. It has already given rise to new litigation from climate activists and, based on my conversations with ECtHR judges, I believe they will continue to find success under this interpretation.“We must do more to make the case for this broader perspective and build the evidence base for how incorporating environmental rights into national systems shapes substantive outcomes.""Mary RobinsonAdditionally, the concept is currently under consideration before the ICJ in itsAdvisory Opinion relating to the Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change. At the request of the UN General Assembly, the ICJ will determine the existing financial liability of countries for their contribution to climate change and what actions countries must take to prevent climate change. Oral statements were made before the Court in December. Many of countries seeking compensation for damages caused by climate change argued the obligation exists under current international law, citing the ECtHR opinion. However,the Biden administration disagreed. The U.S. argued that without explicit language in a treaty no right can be established.Robinson also addressed the use of legislation to impact the actions of businesses.""We should acknowledge the important efforts that have been made to address these problems, including agreement on international frameworks like the UN Global Compact on Business and Human Rights… and the importance of these guiding principles on business and human rights and steps at the national and regional levels to make these standards biding. Most recently the EU’s long awaited corporate sustainability due diligence directive coming into force.”The CSDDD was adopted in 2024 as the third part in a climate change packaged aimed at addressing human rights and climate change actions by businesses. The EU Taxonomy defined sustainability actions by businesses. The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive created environmental, social, and governance reporting requirements for businesses with a presence in the EU. The CSDDD created a legal liability for actions of the businesses that violate climate and human rights goals.However, the Taxonomy, CSRD, and CSDDD are currently being reworked under the anticipatedOmnibus Simplification Package, set to be released on February 26. It is believed that requirements and obligations will be significantly reduced. While not addressed in her speech, in a one-on-one conversation after Robinson said she hopes that does not happen.Addressing the broader ESG movement, Robinson stated,""Unfortunately, the realty today is that, while some leaders are trying to help, too much power continues to be exercised by a relative small number of autocratic, and largely male, leaders of countries, as well as heads of major companies who, instead of speaking up for human rights and rule of law, are too frequently leading push back against more responsible governance, including corporate governance.“We can see this in the continuing backlash against environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, integration in investing coming from a group of influential politicians and businesses people… The fact is that, when effectively implemented, such efforts are not only the right thing to do, but are also good for the bottom line.”The links between climate change and human rights continue to grow stronger as legal developments move quickly in this area of law. What was considered an out of the box legal argument only a few years ago is quickly becoming an accepted standard. Businesses and conservative leaders will continue to fight this effort. Climate activists will find solace in Robinson’s closing quote from Nelson Mandela, “it always seems impossible until it is done.”Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"

What Are CFOs Saying About Climate Action Amid Geopolitical Uncertainty?,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/we-dont-have-time/2025/02/17/what-are-cfos-saying-about-climate-action-amid-geopolitical-uncertainty/,"InnovationSustainabilityWhat Are CFOs Saying About Climate Action Amid Geopolitical Uncertainty?ByIngmar Rentzhog, Contributor.Ingmar Rentzhog is the CEO and founder of We Don’t Have Time.forWe Don’t Have TimeFollow AuthorFeb 17, 2025, 01:35pm ESTSave ArticleComment500 Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) from the US, UK, UAE, and India participated in the studyGetty ImagesFor months, headlines have been dominated bycompanieswalking backordelaying climate commitments. Rising costs, geopolitical tensions, and economic uncertainty have fueled concerns that corporate sustainability efforts might be losing momentum. However, a new survey of 500 CFOs tells a different story:Far from backing down, financial leaders are doubling down on climate action and sustainibility—recognizing it as a necessary investment in both long-term profitability and business resilience.According to the report“Staying the course: Chief financial officers and the green transition,”released on February 17, 2025, a strong majority of CFOs remain committed to increasing climate investments—with many expecting higher financial returns from green initiatives than from traditional investments.This suggests a fundamental change in corporate financial strategy. Sustainability is no longer viewed as a matter of corporate social responsibility—it is now a financial imperative driven by market opportunities, risk management, and evolving regulatory landscapes.This survey, conducted by We Don’t Have Time and Kearney, gathered insights from CFOs across the United States, United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, and India. The data reveals a shift in corporate finance: sustainability is no longer viewed as a niche concern but as a core business strategy.""The perspective of CFOs is often overlooked in the corporate sustainability debate, yet their role is crucial. As those in control of financial levers, CFOs are uniquely positioned to have a long-term impact on business strategy. And our study highlights that they’re already taking steps in this direction.""Beth Bovis, Global Sustainability Lead at Kearney and one of the report’s co-authors.Key Findings: CFOs See Sustainability as Profitable2024 CFO Study by Kearney and We Don't Have TimeImage from reportMORE FOR YOUCourt Lets Trump Fire Watchdog Chief For Now: Here’s Where Trump And Musk Are Winning—And Losing—In Court‘Hamilton’ Cancels Kennedy Center Show Run In Protest Of Trump’s ‘Purge’Fox News Sets Record As Trump’s Speech Draws 32 Million ViewersBeth Bovis, Global Sustainability Lead at KearneyPress Image, Kearney93% recognize a clear business case for investing in sustainability, yet 61% still view these investments primarily as a cost rather than a value creator—suggesting financial models still need to evolve.92% plan to increase sustainability investments in 2025, with more than half committing to “significant” increases.69% of CFOs expect higher returns on sustainability initiatives compared to traditional investments—a clear sign that sustainability is increasingly seen as a financially sound business strategy.65% are already measuring the cost of inaction, particularly in the United States (75%), signaling increasing awareness of the risks of failing to act on climate.61% of CFOs see sustainability investment primarily as cost decision rather than as something that creates valueThe Financial Shift: Why CFOs Are Investing More in SustainabilityHistorically, sustainability efforts have been led by CEOs and Chief Sustainability Officers (CSOs), while CFOs focused on risk mitigation rather than proactively funding green initiatives. That is changing.The latest data signals a major shift in financial strategy. CFOs are increasingly viewing sustainability not as a regulatory burden, but as a growth catalyst. More than two-thirds now expect green investments to outperform traditional ones, reinforcing the idea that sustainability is a value driver, not just a compliance requirement.Additionally, rising regulatory risks, including new sustainability disclosure rules, are prompting CFOs to integrate climate-related financial planning into their broader business strategy—ensuring long-term resilience and profitability.One key takeaway from the report is that companies prioritizing sustainability are not just preparing for regulatory shifts—they are actively positioning themselves as leaders in an evolving global economy.The Reality Check: A Gap in CFO PerspectivesHowever,the findings also expose a contradiction: 69% of CFOs expect strong financial returns from sustainability, but 61% still see it as primarily a cost. This indicates that while CFOs understand the potential for long-term financial gain, many still lack the right financial models to capture the true value of sustainability investments.This highlights a critical gap: Businesses must evolve financial evaluation models to account for the full impact of green investments—including avoided costs, regulatory compliance benefits, and long-term brand value.Taking Immediate Action: CFOs Prioritize Practical Sustainability MeasuresInstead of waiting for 2050 net-zero goals, CFOs are prioritizing near-term, high-impact sustainability measures that generate measurable financial and environmental returns.The top investment priorities for 2025 include:Sustainable materials– Reducing emissions by shifting to renewable and low-impact resources.Sustainable innovation & partnerships– Investing in clean technology and collaborations that drive green solutions.Energy management & waste reduction– Lowering costs through energy efficiency and resource optimization.Supply chain decarbonization– Integrating sustainability into sourcing and logistics operations.This shift also reflects a broader trend in corporate strategy—where financial leaders are moving from passive climate commitments to active, data-driven decision-making that integrates sustainability into core business functions.Sustainability and Workforce Strategies: A Generational ShiftThe report also highlights how workforce expectations are influencing CFO decision-making. 71% of CFOs now consider sustainability in employee retirement funds—a clear response to employees demanding greener investment options. Moreover, 94% integrate sustainability into broader investment decisions, suggesting that ESG considerations are no longer a “bonus” but an essential factor in financial planning.This is a significant shift. As employees and investors push for more values-aligned financial strategies, CFOs are responding by embedding sustainability into core financial decision-making.As younger generations take on leadership roles, sustainability-driven financial decisions will likely become the standard rather than the exception.What Do the CFOs’ Answers Mean for the Green Transition?While corporate sustainability setbacks have made headlines, the latest data presents a more optimistic outlook. Financial decision-makers are not pulling back on green investments; instead, they are doubling down. The connection between sustainability and profitability is clearer than ever, with a majority of CFOs recognizing the financial advantages of green investments. Moreover, assessing the cost of inaction has become mainstream, as companies increasingly view failing to invest in sustainability as a greater financial risk than making the transition.A Joint Call to Action from CFOs and Financial InstitutionsWhile financial decision-makers are standing firm on green investments, the policy landscape must support them. CFOs are increasingly aligning investment strategies with climate goals, but they need regulatory consistency, clear sustainability reporting frameworks, and strong policy signals to ensure long-term success.This call for stability isn’t just coming from CFOs.A coalition of over 200 investors, managing €6.6 trillion in assets, has recently urged the European Commission to protect its sustainable finance regulations amid discussions of potential rollbacks. These investors warn that weakening green finance rules would create uncertainty, slow capital flows toward climate solutions, and undermine Europe’s competitiveness in the net-zero economy.The message from both CFOs and major financial institutions is clear: The future of finance is green. Now is the time for businesses and policymakers to accelerate—not retreat from—climate action.Disclaimer: Kearney is one of We Don’t Have Time’s partners but has neither paid for nor been consulted on this article.We Don’t Have Time is the world’s largest media platform for climate action, dedicated to democratizing knowledge about climate solutions and mobilizing global action toward a prosperous, fossil-free future.

With funding patterns shifting, regions changing hands and emerging as leaders, and technological advancements paving the way, climate tech remains a growing focus in the global economy.2023 Challenges and 2024 ReboundThe climate tech sector continues its decade-long upwards trajectory, however, it’s not immune to broader economic pressures, with venture capital and private equity investments in climate tech having fallen by an astonishing 40% in 2023. While this decline is significant, it remains less severe than the 50% average drop seen across all sectors, and investment in the sector quickly rebounded in 2024: “This resurgence reflects the growing recognition of climate tech as a critical sector for both environmental and economic sustainability,” said Karolina Lewandowska, Co-founder of StarBeam Capital. “It’s not just about tackling emissions but creating scalable solutions that address pressing industrial challenges.”Europe Emerges as a Key Player, but the U.S. Leads in InvestmentRegionally, Europe has positioned itself as a frontrunner in climate tech investment. Between 2016 and 2021, European climate tech investments grew 7.0x, surpassing the global average of 4.9x. The UK, Sweden, and Germany emerged as leading hubs for venture capital funding in 2023 and 2024, highlighting the region’s commitment to sustainable innovation.However, in 2024, the United States overtook China as the top climate tech financing market: $6.7 billion was raised in the first half of 2024 in the U.S., compared to $5.1 billion in China. This marked a reversal from 2023 when China led with $14.5 billion versus the U.S.’s $9.8 billion in the first half. U.S. resilience was supported by policies like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and further driven by increased cross-border investments.This landmark legislation has provided a substantial boost to clean energy initiatives, driving private-sector investment. “The IRA has been a game-changer,” John Tough, Managing Partner at Energize Capital explained. “It has catalyzed funding for development projects, with hundreds of millions already allocated. Even if political changes lead to some adjustments, the overall impact is unlikely to be reversed.”MORE FOR YOUTrump Freezes Ukraine Aid After Confrontation With ZelenskyyWWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades On March 3, 2025Today’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, March 4thShifting Investment PrioritiesInvestment patterns within the climate tech landscape are changing: emerging technologies like carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) are gaining momentum. These innovations are increasingly recognized as essential to addressing hard-to-decarbonize sectors.“CCUS represents a transformative opportunity to tackle industrial emissions,” said Lewandowska. “Investors are beginning to understand its potential for both environmental and financial returns.”“Energy-related startups accounted for 35% of climate tech funding in the first three quarters of 2024, up from 30% in 2023,” noted Tough. “This focus reflects a pivot toward areas that deliver immediate, large-scale emissions reductions.”Investor focus is increasingly directed towards emissions-intensive sectors and technologies with the highest emissions-reduction potential. Industrial sector start-ups in North America nearly doubled their share of investment, rising from 9% to 16% between 2022 and 2023.“Globally, the competition to lead in clean energy is intensifying,” Lewandowska observed. “Countries recognize that leadership in this sector is both an economic and strategic advantage.” Energy-related climate tech investments have surged globally, with China’s share increasing from 2% in 2018 to 22.2% in 2023.In 2024AI-powered climate tech solutionsgained significant traction, with investment increasing to £4.73 billion in the first three quarters, representing 14.6% of all climate tech investment, up from 7.5% in 2023.Throughout 2025, mature technologies like solar, wind power, and electric vehicles are expected to continue theirexponential deployment. Technologies such as sustainable aviation fuel, low-carbon cement, long-duration energy storage, and zero-carbon shipping are also predicted to show exponentialgrowth to scale in 2025.More funds are expected to be launched in 2025 to provide capital for industrial technologies such as grid strengthening, and nature-based solutions.Investor Diversification and Market MaturityA notable trend in climate tech investment is the diversification of investor profiles. Traditional venture capitalists are now joined by growth equity, private equity, and infrastructure-focused firms.“This diversification is a sign of a maturing market,” said Tough. “We’re seeing substantial capital infusions from players who specialize in scaling and deploying proven technologies.”The industry is shifting from innovation-driven funding to deployment-focused strategies. This evolution reflects the growing readiness of climate tech solutions to be implemented on a large scale.“Technological innovation is vital, but we’re now at a stage where deployment is the primary focus,” Lewandowska explained. “This shift is attracting infrastructure backers who bring both expertise and capital.”Navigating Political and Economic UncertaintyAs discussions around a potential Trump presidency gain traction, the climate tech sector is preparing for a possible shift in federal policies. Lewandowska anticipates challenges but remains optimistic about the sector’s ability to adapt.“A Trump presidency will likely scale back federal incentives and prioritize fossil fuel production,” she acknowledged. “However, bipartisan support for technologies like nuclear energy, geothermal power, and carbon capture could ensure continued investment in these areas.”To navigate potential federal policy changes, startups are focusing on building self-sustaining revenue models and diversifying funding sources. International markets and partnerships with corporations aiming to meet ESG goals are also key strategies.“Startups must prioritize products with clear cost advantages and resilience to policy shifts,” Lewandowska advised. “Engaging with global investors and focusing on markets with robust climate policies will be crucial.”Reasons for OptimismDespite uncertainties, strong reasons for optimism remain. The global energy transition has reached a critical inflection point, driven by market forces rather than individual government actions.“Renewables like solar and wind have become cost-competitive and scalable,” Lewandowska noted. “This momentum is no longer reliant on political incentives alone.”Corporate commitments to sustainability are further bolstering climate tech investments. Long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and integration of decarbonization into business strategies reflect the private sector’s increasing focus on clean energy.“Corporations see sustainability as a competitive advantage,” Tough added. “This trend ensures consistent private-sector investment, even amid shifting political landscapes.”State-level policies in the U.S., such as those in California and New York, act as counterbalances to federal policy changes. Globally, initiatives like the European Green Deal and the Paris Agreement provide a stable framework for investment and innovation.“International commitments and market demand for renewables are outpacing fossil fuels,” Lewandowska said. “This creates a resilient ecosystem for climate tech.”Market Dynamics and Technological ProgressMarket forces continue to drive the clean energy transition, with renewable technologies becoming increasingly cost-effective.“Technological advancements like green hydrogen and advanced battery storage are transforming the energy landscape,” Lewandowska explained. “These innovations are viable even without significant federal incentives.”Tough emphasized the role of capital costs in shaping industry dynamics. “Lower interest rates make existing technologies more competitive,” he said. “Proven solutions like solar and batteries will continue to advance, independent of political cycles.”A Bright FutureThe numbers speak for themselves. Global investments in clean energy are nearing$2 trillion annually, nearly double the spending on new fossil fuel projects, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).“This capital flow underscores an irreversible shift towards sustainable energy solutions,” Lewandowska highlighted. “The transition to net-zero is firmly anchored in economic necessity and environmental urgency.”As the climate tech sector evolves, its resilience and adaptability position it for continued growth. The alignment of market forces, technological innovation, and societal demands ensures a promising future for the industry.“Innovation, collaboration, and commitment are driving us toward a sustainable energy future,” Lewandowska concluded. “The momentum is unstoppable, regardless of short-term challenges.”Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsiteorsome of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"

That includes a mix of Pandora-owned, franchise-owned and third-party distribution across the globe.And while its core jewelry charm-and-bracelet segment accounted for 74% of total sales, its extended full-jewelry segment, called “Fuel with more,” including lab-grown diamonds, was on fire, up 22% to $1.1 billion (DKK 8,149).MORE FOR YOUTrump Freezes Ukraine Aid After Confrontation With ZelenskyyWWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades On March 3, 2025Today’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, March 4thGrowing Despite A Market SlowdownOne can argue Pandora is growing in a stagnant market because it has the right product at the right price in all the right places with the right promotion and for the right people, i.e. the traditional 4Ps of marketing plus the missing P-people.CEO Alexander Lacik says that the P-formula still applies but it is only the tactical piece. And in the face of a slowing market, many companies leaned into the price and promotion part of the equation to boost sales.“It’s the highest level of promotions we’ve seen in my six years at Pandora and we have seen a negative sentiment in the industry over the past couple of years,” shared CEO Alexander Lacik with me.“What emerged at the end of last year and also continuing into this year is that more brands are struggling and moving to heavier discounting to get the sales volume they need,” he continued. “There’s not a lot of volume out there and when you go for the volume, you pay for the volume.”The downward promotional spiral leads to commoditization, ultimately threatening long-term sustainable growth once the market returns. Instead of pushing for volume through discounting, though he admits Pandora has “partaken to some extent,” Pandora has invested in brand building, the results of which are now showing.Interbrand named Pandora to the100 best global brandsin 2024 where it sits alongside Tiffany, Cartier, Louis Vuitton, Hermès, Chanel, Gucci, Dior and Prada.“In any market condition, there will be winners and losers, and it’s usually the brands that continue investing in their identity and customer relationships that emerge stronger. This is the essence of our Phoenix strategy, and six consecutive quarters of double-digit growth in a challenging market show that it is working,” Lacik asserted.Implementing Strategy For Sustainable Long-Term GrowthWhen Lacik joined Pandora in 2019, after years of working with CPG giants Procter & Gamble and Reckitt, he faced the career challenge of a lifetime. Revenues had been flat for the two preceding years at around $3 billion, then the pandemic hit and sales went into a tailspin, dropping 8% in 2019 and another 11% in 2021 to $2.7 billion, below 2016 levels.The turnaround began in May 2021 with the introduction of Pandora’s Phoenix strategy with the goal of achieving between 5% and 7% organic compound annual growth rate from 2021 to 2023 and since revised to between 7% and 9% CAGR from 2023 to 2026.The Phoenix strategy hinges on four growth pillars:Transformation Into A Full-Jewelry BrandBuilding upon Pandora’s strength as an affordable, collectible and emotionally evocative charm-and-bracelet brand, it set out to expand its product assortment into new jewelry product categories with an elevated design sensibility.Key to brand transformation was to step-up the presentation of the evolving product offerings in stores with a new store concept called Evoke 2.0. By 2026 some 60% of Pandora’s owned and operated stores will be under the Evoke 2.0 model.Design To Broaden The AssortmentThe strategy distinguished its collections between Core collections, i.e. Moments and Pandora ME, which are the brand’s charm-and-bracelet core that share similar design aesthetics, and “Fuel with more” that expand the range into a full-jewelry assortment with new design sensibilities to appeal to both current customers and bring in new customers, such as its lab-grown diamond collection of rings, necklaces, earrings and bracelets.Brand collaborations, such as with Disney, Marvel, HBO’s Game of Thrones and Netflix, stretch the brand further to a wider audience.Expand Market PenetrationPandora continues to see opportunities for growth in new markets, to continue to build in established markets where it has high market share, such as the U.K., Italy and Australia, and to expand into what it describes as “less penetrated markets,” notably the U.S., Germany, France and China.In the U.S., the Pheonix strategy set out to double business from the 2019 base year of $660 million, which it has achieved. And now it looks to continue to grow as market share in the U.S. is in the low single-digit levels.China is more problematic. It was hit harder by Covid and didn’t bounce back as other markets did. Lacik expects building a substantial business in China – it currently represents about 1% of revenues – will be a “longer journey than originally anticipated.”He added, “All the research that I’m reading is that the consumer sentiment in China is the lowest it’s been since that research has been going on. And it doesn’t necessarily seem to be going better, to be honest.”Personalization Through Retail Execution And DigitalizationPersonalizing the customer experience is a multiple-prong initiative across customized IRL experiences with store personnel, in-store engraving services, a new loyalty program and an enhanced digital experience.It just launched an enhanced Pandora website with more video presentations and supported by AI in Canada and Italy. Following its proven “test-and-learn” process, it will be expanding that platform into new markets as the year progresses.Sustainability To Support The PlanetAs the world’s largest jewelry brand, Pandora has a special responsibility to lead the industry in sustainability and good business practices. It transitioned to fully-recycled gold and silver in 2024 and been named toCorporate Knights’andTime Magazine’slist of the 100 world’s most sustainable brands. It also has a long-term mission to reduce emissions throughout its value chain in half by 2030 and be net-zero by 2040.Lacik has also been named to the board of theWatch & Jewellery Initiative 2030, a coalition of leading jewelry companies committed to ESG and sustainability in the industry where he’ll rub shoulders with leaders of the world’s luxury jewelry brands.Think DifferentlyComing to Pandora as an outsider with no prior jewelry experience has worked to Lacik’s advantage guiding Pandora into its next phase of growth. He isn’t blinded by the industry’s conventional thinking and sees opportunities where an industry insider might not.That is evident in his thinking about the digital connection with customers that Pandora will bring forward to new markets after it tests-and-learns from the prototypes introduced in Italy and Canada.“Online is actually my number one store, say we get some 700 to 900 million visitors a year. But only about 2% actually convert, which is pretty typical of other brands. Many marketers spend time talking about what would happen if we could go from 2% to 2.1% or 2.2% conversion rate. But if you are in a two-to-2.1% mindset, that’s incremental; you’re only tinkering with stuff.“We must think another way. What about the 98% who are walking away? How can we get more of those 98% engaged with us and keep them from leaving. That’s what we are looking at and the first step is what we’ve done in Canada and Italy. It is actually quite promising.”See Also:https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfaithfull/2025/02/05/pandora-sales-sparkle-but-worlds-biggest-jeweler-cautions-over-2025/https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2024/11/08/pandora-jewelry-wins-and-will-keep-winning-with-the-right-strategy-at-the-right-time/Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsiteorsome of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"

That’s at the heart of the success of some list veterans.Chime, in its seventh year on theFintech 50, is the largest digital bank in America with seven million monthly users of its app. It has been a leader in driving down costs–it charges no monthly or overdraft fees on its checking accounts and makes paychecks available sooner. Tala, on the list for an impressive ninth consecutive year, leverages smartphone data and proprietary algorithms to make loans of $20 to $500 each to customers in countries including Kenya, India and Mexico. Those little loans add up–to $1.3 billion in 2024 alone. Propel, in its sixth consecutive list appearance, helps empower those getting government benefits, with a free debit card, personal finance tools and special deals. In 2024, it reached GAAP profitability as revenue climbed 24% to $47 million.But there are still underserved segments to be found–as evidenced by two first-timers on the list.Bilt Rewardsis bringing a benefit to the nation’s stretched renters–they can earn perks like airline miles on their rental payments. In 2024, Bilt processed and rewarded members on more than $36 billion in annual rent and HOA payments, up from $11 billion in 2023.Meanwhile, True Link Financial offers a special debit card for those with dementia or other mental disabilities–the $12 per month service allows those managing the card holder’s finances to set spending controls to protect against fraud.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The Iowa-based company plans a 2,500-mile,$9 billionpipeline to capture carbon dioxide from 57 ethanol plants across five states, including eastern South Dakota, and transport it to North Dakota forunderground storage. The project would capitalize onfederal tax creditsincentivizing the prevention of heat-trapping carbon emissions.The commissionrejectedSummit’s first permit application in 2023, in part due to the pipeline route’s conflicts with local ordinances mandating minimum distances between pipelines and existing features.The project has a storage permit in North Dakota and route permits in North Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota, while Nebraska has no state permitting process for carbon pipelines. The project also faces litigation from opponents in multiple states.The Sioux Falls meeting focused on residents in Minnehaha, Lincoln, Turner and Union counties. The commission heldanother meeting in Mitchellearlier in the day.Most of Wednesday’s attendees opposed the pipeline — evident by applause often filling the room after opponents spoke. The opponents who spoke primarily reiterated concerns about safety and impacts to farmland affected by the pipeline’s planned route, which were raised during the company’s initial attempt at a permit.Opponents also spoke against efforts to designate the pipeline as a common carrier, which would allow the use of eminent domain to push the project through. TheSouth Dakota Supreme Courtruled last year that the pipeline has not yet proven it should be allowed to take private land for public use. The high court sent the case back to a lower court, where the company is trying to prove its case.SubscribeMeanwhile, some state lawmakers have proposedlegislation to ban carbon pipelinesfrom using eminent domain.Betty Strom, whose property would be crossed by the pipeline, said it would be a “forever hazard across my land.”“Summit is in it for the tax credits. They don’t care about property rights, safety, the damage to property, its value or the long-term consequences,” Strom said. “Please deny this permit again.”Representatives from Summit explained why the route was selected and reviewed safety regulations and standards for the pipeline.In a handout, Summit said the project would include $1.9 billion in capital expenditures in South Dakota, add 3,000 construction jobs while the pipeline is being built and support 260 jobs annually.Project supporters said it would provide economic opportunities to South Dakota if implemented.Al Giese, an Iowa farmer, board member for the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association and owner of a feed and trucking company doing business in South Dakota, told the commission that the “carbon sequestration train, locally and nationally, has left the station.”“Yes, it is a South Dakota issue. It is a Midwestern issue. But we must move forward with sequestering carbon not only for the vitality of the ag sector but for all the economies in the Midwestern states,” Giese said. “There’s no other way to go about it.”The nextpublic hearingswill be in De Smet and Watertown on Thursday, and in Aberdeen and Redfield on Friday.Makenzie Huber is a lifelong South Dakotan who regularly reports on the intersection of politics and policy with health, education, social services and Indigenous affairs.

Many plants have marketing groups to try to sell it – for refrigeration systems, in greenhouses, and similar. Technically, this is CCU.There are also systems to collect CO2, inject it in wells to get more oil out. Also CCU when non-geologic sources are used. Some argue that they should get some CCS credits, because some of the CO2 stays in the oilfield.Building a pipeline across creation to put it in a hole does seem daft.4J BolesFebruary 18, 2025 6:25 amI don’t understand how they would capture the C02 to begin with, that would take a lot of FF I bet.15philincaliforniaReply toJ BolesFebruary 18, 2025 1:21 pmIt comes out of the top of the fermenter and it’s pretty easy to capture. Some bioethanol plants actually capture it and sell it. There are variants to this but, in general, yeast converts one molecule of sugar to two molecules of ethanol and two CO2s.Don’t get me wrong and go thinking I’m supporting this attempted theft of $9 Billion from the taxpayer. It’s pretty much the same as paying people to dig ditches and fill them in.6Zig Zag WandererFebruary 18, 2025 6:31 amThe consequences of a CO2 leak in a populatrd area are terrifying to imagine. What kind of lunatics want to do this?10AlbertBrandFebruary 18, 2025 6:36 amIt seems like no one ever learns.  CO2 can asphyxiate you;  it’s concentration governs our breathing not lack of oxygen but CO2 level.  We breathe out 40,000 ppm but pure CO2 will kill you.  It is odorless, colorless and tasteless.  What better way to kill animals?(humans included). This goes beyond stupid.  We do not need any more imbeciles running things.23Mr.Reply toAlbertBrandFebruary 18, 2025 6:55 amMaybe it’s not so stupid if the real purpose is to achieve what you reveal are its capabilities?7Sparta Nova 4Reply toMr.February 18, 2025 7:39 amThe Population Bomb is the manual.62hotel9February 18, 2025 6:38 amHere is a thought, strip away the tax give aways and force Summit to foot the bill themselves, see how far this stupidity goes then.33DD MoreReply to2hotel9February 18, 2025 10:53 amThe project would capitalize onfederal tax creditsincentivizing the prevention of heat-trapping carbon emissions.So all the US taxpayers are going to pay the bill?They are talking to a lot of farmers, who know how much extra CO2 increases their crop yeilds.4bnice2000Reply toDD MoreFebruary 18, 2025 11:57 amCan Trump remove any possibility of federal tax credits ?That would kill the whole idea completely.And carbon emissions do not “trap heat” so the whole premise of CCS is complete nonsense.6oeman50Reply to2hotel9February 19, 2025 3:17 amWhat the government giveth, the government can taketh away.Take that into account when you do your risk analysis for $9 billion.2Uzi1February 18, 2025 6:57 amUltimately the taxpayers/consumers pay the bill for this nonsense! CO2 capture is a fool’s errand invented by clueless politicians and radical climate activists. Just say NO to pipelines for CO2 capture/underground storage!20MR166February 18, 2025 7:03 amWell I really doubt that these US tax credits will be around for long.  DOGE will see to that.  President Trump is ending most of the Green agenda.18Dr. BobFebruary 18, 2025 7:06 amThis has bigger ramifications than just CO2 capture and sequestration.  Ethanol producers need to lower their CI (Carbon Intensity) for EtOH production or pay penalties in California for failing to meet the CI targets under the Low Carbon Fuels Standard.  This standard is designed to lower the GHG emissions from all fuels in CA to help them meet the AB32 GHG reduction act requirements.  Ethanol already has minimal GHG reduction potential but capture of CO2 from fermentation (half of the carbon in starch ends up as CO2 and the other half as EtOH). This will reduce the profitability of EtOH production.A second issue is that ethanol producers worried about decreasing demand for gasoline will cause decreased demand for EtOH.  Surplus EtOH can be converted into Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) which the airlines need to use to meet their International Air Transit Authority (IATA) commitments and in Europe and the UK, government mandates to use SAF for all flights originating in those areas.  Corn Ethanol to SAF has a CI essentially the same as conventional jet fuel making it pointless to produce and purchase this renewable fuel as there is no GHG emissions reduction.Ethanol producers were counting on the Navigator and Summit CO2 pipelines to help them lower the CI of EtOH so they could meet mandates and generate more revenue.  Not Anymore!5Sparta Nova 4February 18, 2025 7:39 amThe definition of heat is the flow of thermal energy across a thermal gradient, from hot to cold.If one traps heat, it is no longer heat. One cannot trap heat.Sequestering carbon is good for the ag sector? On what planet?8Steve CaseFebruary 18, 2025 7:57 amI was going to put up an image of aTibetan Prayer Wheelwitha $9,000,000,000price tagslapped on it, but I’m out of time.5DenisFebruary 18, 2025 8:01 am“…we must move forward with sequestering carbon not only for the vitality of the ag sector but for all the economies in the Midwestern states,” Giese said. “There’s no other way to go about it.”  Or they could read the results of work by Drs Happer and Wijngaarden concluding that doubling CO2 in our atmosphere will cause less than a 1C increase in temperature, and then do nothing.  Giese is simply a science denyer.10Steve CaseReply toDenisFebruary 18, 2025 8:21 amBesides that:1. More rain is not a problem.2. Warmer weather is not a problem.3. More arable land is not a problem.4. Longer growing seasons is not a problem.5. CO2 greening of the earth is not a problem.6. There isn’t any Climate Crisis.30Dave FairReply toDenisFebruary 18, 2025 11:34 amNo, Giese is simply a crony capitalist.  Federal and State governments have been buying off farm State voters with massive ethanol subsidies.5willhaasReply toDenisFebruary 18, 2025 7:25 pmYes, there is no real evidence thqt CO2 has any effect on our global climate system.  There is plenty os scientific rationale to conslude that the climate sensivity of CO2 is effectively zero.  The AGW hypothesis has been falsified by science.0Ex-KaliforniaKookReply toDenisFebruary 19, 2025 2:14 pmSeems to me that since CO2 improves crop production (the reason they pump it into greenhouses) they should punch pinholes in the pipeline for its entire length and thus fertilize farms from Iowa to South Dakota. Forget storing it. Get it to where it will do the most good!1DMAFebruary 18, 2025 8:27 amThese guys need to hold off until the endangerment finding is reviewed.(Report due this week I think). If it is abolished as it should be there is no incentive to capture CO2 and the federal subsidies will have to be withdrawn because they are predicated on the concept that CO2 is a pollutant.11CD in WisconsinFebruary 18, 2025 8:31 amHow about if we quit making ethanol for blending in gasoline altogether?Anyone is free to correct me if am wrong here, but these are the points which, as I understand them, makes ethanol production a bad idea:1)  It requires considerable water usage which puts pressure on local water supply sources.2). It drives up the price of corn and thus food prices.3)  Ethanol has a lower energy content (30-33% less?) than gasoline which lowers fuel economy per gallon when blended with gasoline.4)  Diverts natural gas from use for heating and cooking when natural gas is used to brew ethanol.Any regulations or laws requiring ethanol be blended with gasoline would no doubt have to be removed from the books.  Don’t know if Lee Zeldin at the EPA is planning on looking at this, but I hope he does.13Rud IstvanReply toCD in WisconsinFebruary 18, 2025 8:50 amYou are mistaken about ethanol in gasoline on three counts.It is an octane enhancer replacing groundwater polluting MBTE, itself developed to replace tetraethyl lead. Without it there would be less gasoline.It is an oxygenate that helps reduce smog. The original 10% max blendwall was set for LA in summer for premium gas. Most gas has less, and anything more is just ag politics.Although it consumes 42% of US corn by dry weight, it returns 27% distillers grain which is a superior ruminants feed supplement to alfalfa. So the food impact is small.8Richard GreeneReply toRud IstvanFebruary 18, 2025 10:09 amThe protein and fiber that remain become a high-quality animal feed called distillers grains. In fact, nearly 40% of the nutritional value of corn used in ethanol production is retained – and returned to the feed sector in the form of distillers grains and corn oil.-1DonMReply toRichard GreeneFebruary 18, 2025 10:27 amquit whining1philincaliforniaReply toDonMFebruary 18, 2025 8:39 pmActually, I don’t think he is just whining. There’s a pretty credible argument that the bioethanol industry actually converts starch to distiller’s grains (DDGs) which are a food source that is more palatable to cattle and chickens (as they don’t handle starch too well). So the DDGs are the actual product with concentrated nutritional value. This is pretty factual stuff. The ethanol then becomes the waste product and, as Rud points out above, it is a way cleaner oxygenate than MTBE. It’s also high octane. Of course, it has its drawbacks, primarily due to its hygroscopicity. The industry also keeps employed a lot of the populations of Iowa, Nebraska, S. Dakota et al.2jayrowReply toRud IstvanFebruary 18, 2025 2:13 pmRud – what are your thoughts on using the CO2 to CaCO3 capture method?1bnice2000Reply tojayrowFebruary 18, 2025 3:01 pmIf the CaCO₃produced has some useful commercial purpose.. go for it.If it is going to cost money, don’t bother with it.1MR166Reply toCD in WisconsinFebruary 18, 2025 8:58 amEthanol production is not all bad.  The byproduct of this process is livestock feed so all of the nutritional value of the corn is not lost.  The ethanol in the gas helps it burn cleaner and raises the octane.  That being said, more is not better as far as the percentage in gas is concerned.4philincaliforniaReply toMR166February 18, 2025 8:44 pmYes, I probably should have scrolled down and seen your comment before adding mine above but yes, the industry fought hard to get allowable levels of ethanol up to 15% (E15). They succeeded, but I think it still runs around 10% as the national average. It took so long to lobby it up to 15% that I’m pretty sure that’s where it will top out.0Bruce CobbFebruary 18, 2025 8:48 amAl Giese, an Iowa farmer, board member for the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association and owner of a feed and trucking company doing business in South Dakota, told the commission that the “carbon sequestration train, locally and nationally, has left the station.”Reminds me of the song that goes:Pardon me boys,Is that the Scamanooga Choo Choo?6Rud IstvanFebruary 18, 2025 8:52 amA senseless pipeline designed to milk useless subsidies.19KevinMReply toRud IstvanFebruary 18, 2025 9:38 amYep.A test for current administration.If it includes transporting across 5 states, interstate commerce, then it becomes a federal issue.10AlbertBrandFebruary 18, 2025 9:20 amAnother comment.  Ethanol has serious consequences.  Fuel lines can leak in lawn mowers, gaskets can be affected.  At least my diesel engine in my farm tractor is safe.  Older automotive engines need lubricants which unleaded gas can not provide so must have additives put in the gas tank3Richard GreeneFebruary 18, 2025 9:59 amEthanol and wood pellets are two non-green “green” subjects that get very little attention in conservative media. Nor do they get much attention in the left-biased mass media. Those people fearing CO2 emissions should be against ethanol and burning wood pellets.MEANWHILE:As of the end of 2023, there were 187 ethanol plants in the United States. This number remained the same from 2022, but the combined capacity of these plants increased by 438 million gallons per year.0Bruce CobbFebruary 18, 2025 10:03 amOne thing’s for sure: Big Corn loves ethanol. I’m not sure how much of a benefit it is to those forced to both buy and subsidize it.4ToldYouSoFebruary 18, 2025 11:47 amFrom the above article:“The Iowa-based company plans a 2,500-mile, $9 billion pipeline to capture carbon dioxide from 57 ethanol plants across five states, including eastern South Dakota, and transport it to North Dakota for underground storage.”Any evidence—any demonstrated evidendence at all—that the underground storage of megatons of CO2 is technically feasible?  Suppose there’s a leak  . .. what happens, an apology of “Ooops, didn’t see tht coming”?2Dan PangburnFebruary 18, 2025 12:24 pmThe Deep State has recently deleted a web file of monthly measured average global water vapor increase. The file, showing data reported by NASA/RSS from before 1988 through Dec 2023 had been available athttps://data.remss.com/vapor/monthly_1deg/tpw_v07r02_198801_202312.time_series.txtMeasured water vapor has been increasing more than twice as fast as possible from just planet warming and can account for all climate change attributable to humanity with no contribution from burning fossil fuels.https://watervaporandwarming.blogspot.comThe attached graph had no contribution from CO2 and showed an R2 of 0.96.3Harold PierceFebruary 18, 2025 1:49 pmI am going X and tell Musk to kill ethanol production subsidizes.1bnice2000Reply toHarold PierceFebruary 18, 2025 3:03 pmMusk can’t do that..But he can send the suggestion to Trump, who can work on getting it done.0Harold PierceReply tobnice2000February 18, 2025 4:54 pmI just posted the request on X.1willhaasFebruary 18, 2025 7:18 pmThis would be a complete waste of money.  There is no real evidence that CO2 has any effect on our global climate system.  The AGW hypotnesis has been falsified by science.  There is plenty of rationale to support the4 conslusion that the climate sensitivity of cO2 is zero.  The amount of CO2 currently in our atmosphere is way below that whch is optimal for plant growth and hence for life on this planet.  Hence we xhould be adding more CO2 to the atmosphere and not sequestering it.  Based on science this projuct is counter productive and a big waste of money.1roaddogFebruary 18, 2025 11:56 pmHow about we just close the ethanol plants?0c1ueFebruary 20, 2025 8:48 amThe reason the pipelines are heading for North Dakota is because of EOR: enhanced oil recovery. It turns out that the reason fracking only produces hydrocarbon gases and the near gas fluids (NGLs) is because fracking is only pulling out around 10% of the lightest hydrocarbons in a reservoir. A lot of research is going into EOR – which is to use surfactants to try and improve this recovery ratio. Bio, water, CO2 are some candidates but all have very serious short term and/or long term issues. CO2 has the massive federal incentives but the pipelines are the problem.The tech I have been working on – I have been requested to investigate gas2gas: methane to propane because this is the only realistic short/medium term path to provide sufficient volume surfactants of any kind. A pilot project for water and propane EOR just started in ND.0wpDiscuzLoginSign up to comment or become a paid supporter:Click HereDonate to support WUWTThe Maxim of our resolve“Walk toward the fire.

Beyond Consumer Outrage: Rebuilding Trust And Realigning Purpose,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Brandingstrategyinsider.com'}",https://brandingstrategyinsider.com/beyond-consumer-outrage-rebuilding-trust-and-realigning-purpose/,"As the new US administration takes its place in the White House, poised to shape the future of geopolitics and commerce, brand leaders are confronting a stark reality: trust continues to fray. Polarization, misinformation, and a sense of betrayal permeate public discourse. Institutions once seen as pillars of stability are now viewed with suspicion.It’s easy to dismiss the outrage as noise, but what if it’s something more? What if outrage isn’t the enemy but a signal—a mirror reflecting the fractures in trust and purpose we’ve overlooked?When viewed this way, outrage becomes more than a reaction to missteps. It reveals where alignment has broken, offering a chance to recalibrate and reconnect. For brand leaders, I see this as a moment to champion intention, curiosity, and courage. Those willing to lean into this challenge have an opportunity to transform outrage into a catalyst for meaningful social influence and change. Perhaps most importantly, the choices we each make today will shape the future.This article is part of Branding Strategy Insider’s newsletter.You can sign up hereto get thought pieces like this sent to your inbox.Understanding The Landscape: A Crisis In NumbersAcross industries, latching onto the latest social trend with virtue signaling and misalignment between communications and behaviors has come at a time when people are frustrated and no longer giving brands the benefit of the doubt—instead they are asking for consistency, accountability and most importantly resonance alongside relevance. Given the relentless feed of news and information and the pressure to engage in real-time, every message a brand puts out today carries the potential to become a crisis…. It’s impossible to predict who will receive a seemingly innocuous message in the wrong way on the wrong day. And the interconnectedness of challenges—social trends, consumer expectations, and ideological divides—adds even greater complexity.Revealing a profound trust deficit, research statistics offer insight into the landscape, underscoring the disconnect between corporate actions and stakeholder expectations:Only 37% of people globally trust business leadersto act in society’s best interest, a decline of 12% in just one year (Edelman Trust Barometer 2024).72% of Americans believe businesses should stay out of politicsunless it directly affects their operations and only41% of US adults believe businesses should take a public stance on current events(Morning Consult 2024/Gallup and Bentley University poll)61% of consumers are skeptical of corporate sustainability claimsand59% of Americans suspect brands of leveraging social issues for profit(PwC 2024 and Axios- Harris Poll).72% of Americans feel healthcare systems prioritize profitover care (Morning Consult 2024)These numbers narrate a story of disillusionment. Rising costs, unfulfilled promises, and tokenistic gestures deepen public skepticism. In healthcare, the stakes are particularly stark: inaccessible services and soaring expenses amplify feelings of betrayal. —a sentiment epitomized by the shocking assassination of a major healthcare CEO. Outrage stems from this context, a byproduct of disconnection and unmet expectations. Meanwhile,91% of CEOsacknowledge the need to recalibrate ESG programs, yet recalibration without systemic change risks eroding trust further and fueling discontent.Ultimately, brand leaders are being called on to decide what their brands stand for at the highest levels, not to latch on to trends. Yet, how do they do this in a way that addresses existing fractures, realigns purpose, and rebuilds trust?Lessons From History: Cycles Of Outrage And LeadershipHistory often is cyclical.And outrage is not new. In many ways, what we are seeing today is somewhat reflective of the time after the Great Recession. Movements like Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party arose from deep disillusionment with institutions. These moments weren’t just reactions—they were signals of broader public demand for change, which accelerated the early purpose movement. As people were being told the economy had recovered and yet weren’t experiencing this in their own lives, businesses stepped into a leadership void.PepsiCo was one of the earliest brands to embrace purpose, even before the Great Recession in 2006, when Indra Nooyi introduced Performance with Purpose. Paul Polman embedded sustainability into Unilever’s in 2010, after publicly criticizing the stock market’s focus on short-term returns. These efforts accelerated the fledgling purpose movement, demonstrating how businesses could lead by example. Actions like BlackRock’s emphasis on sustainable investing in 2013 and Brand Z’s incorporation of purpose-driven metrics in 2014 signaled the growing demand for businesses to align their strategies with societal needs.Today, the stakes feel even higher than they did then. Indeed, driven in large part by polarized politics, brands now face increasing backlash. And tellingly, the outrage transcends ideological divides: progressive audiences critique greenwashing and performative actions, while conservative groups resist DEI and sustainability efforts. Yet, systemic shifts take time. The trajectory of today’s anger and frustration—and how it will intersect with the priorities of a new administration—remains uncertain. Brands that view this as a moment to pause, stay aligned with their values, and act consistently can position themselves as trusted leaders in this evolving landscape.Decoding Outrage: The Signals And Their MeaningDeconstructing the meaning of today’s outrage requires nuance. Four key drivers help to clarify the complexities:Rage Reflects Systemic Failures:Rage often stems from the perception that brands prioritize profits over people. This sentiment is particularly acute in industries like healthcare, where rising costs and inaccessible services magnify feelings of betrayal.Resistance Reveals Superficiality:Superficial gestures—vague sustainability claims or tokenistic DEI efforts—amplify skepticism. Resistance arises when audiences feel co-opted rather than respected.Reckoning Exposes Misalignment:A reckoning occurs when brands overstep societal boundaries without ensuring coherence between their values and actions. For example, sustainability claims that clash with exploitative supply chain practices erode trust.Rejection Reflects Fear:Fear, often rooted in uncertainty or perceived loss, manifests as rejection. Brands navigating cultural shifts must tread carefully to address anxieties without compromising their values.These drivers interact to form cycles of distrust. To break them, brand leaders must act with coherence, courage, and intentionality—embedding trust-building practices across all facets of a brand’s operations.Seven Principles For Rebuilding Trust And PurposeAdopting an intentional, systemic approach is the best way to rebuild trust and transform outrage into an opportunity. In my work with clients, I have found seven principles help to navigate today’s complex environment. That said, it’s equally important to recognize that there are no guarantees…. I find consistency, alignment, preparedness and courage to be the best mantras.1. Marketers are fiduciariesA marketer’s first role is to be a steward of their brands. Their responsibility is to ensure that every action they take is anchored in purpose and a brand’s core operating principles, not to amplify personal beliefs and values.Acting as a fiduciary requires balancing societal responsibility with business outcomes, harmonizing the influence a brand has the power to wield over culture public discourse with the integrity of the brand’s promises.2. Purpose is a living disciplinePurpose is more than a statement: it’s a compass—true to your business operations yet broad enough to encompasses a social mission. By necessity, purpose must unfold alongside people’s evolving needs and societal expectations. A brand like Natura, whose purpose is to nurture beauty and relationships for a better way of living and doing business, exemplifies this by respecting the biodiversity of the Amazon when sourcing ingredients, integrating sustainability into supply chains and addressing local community needs.Purpose thrives when it’s treated as a discipline requiring intentionality at every level. When a brand leader tells you it’s time to move on from purpose, they’ve misunderstood it entirely—would you ever move on from strategic planning?3. Purpose architecture mitigates riskPurpose without structure and clarity risks becoming superficial. Guided by nuanced audience insights and materiality, purpose architecture offers a strategic framework to differentiate corporate and product brand roles—and further distinguishes operational commitments (sustainability and regulatory compliance) from messaging.Begin developing purpose architecture by systems mapping potentially conflicting perspectives and expectations – spoken and unspoken – of customers, employees, investors and other stakeholders. And, importantly, consider segmenting by ideology to identify both messages that resonate and red flags to navigate and ensure you use scenario planning to be prepared for potential crises.4. A values-driven POV builds confidenceStakeholders seek alignment between a company’s values and its actions. So, it’s essential to identify where your brand has earned the right to lead and take confident, values-driven action. The question isn’t if you should speak up—it’s whether your audience grants you permission to add your voice to the conversation.A clear POV is a lens for navigating this complexity, guiding consistency and clarity necessary to strengthen credibility and avoid virtue signaling. Airbnb’s program that offers housing to refugees is an earnest act of belonging that resonates with people’s deepest values. By turning its ethos into action, Airbnb transforms its mission into tangible hope, rebuilding trust and loyalty at a human level.5. Diversity is competitive advantageDiversity is a strategic asset, driving innovation and connection. A Washington Post/IPSOS poll (April 2024) found 61% of Americans support DEI practices, saying they are a “good thing.” AndMcKinsey data from 2023shows companies with ethnically diverse leadership are 39% more likely to outperform peers. Signaling their belief in its strategic value, bothCostco’s and Apple’s boardsrecently recommended that investors reject shareholder proposals from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) that ask the companies to publish a report on the risk of DEI programs or eliminate them completely.Homogenous brand and marketing teams risk developing campaigns and programs that don’t resonate across different audience demographics and psychographics.OxfordUniversity research indicates that diverse advertising increases short-term sales by 3.5% and long-term sales by 16%, demonstrating how inclusive storytelling is an important aspect of resonating with modern audiences. Importantly, DEI isn’t a prerequisite for hiring diversely; individual brand leaders can always choose to bring people with different backgrounds or who think differently onto their teams, even as official policies are pulled back.6. Sustainability as ResilienceWhen deeply embedded in a brand’s operations, sustainability amplifies trust and fuels innovation.Kantarreports that sustainability adds $193 billion to the value of the top 100 global brands. And 93% of consumers say they want to live more sustainably.By aligning sustainability with long-term business strategy, brands address immediate environmental concerns while demonstrating accountability and forward-thinking approaches. Effective sustainability strategies foster trust and relevance in an increasingly environmentally conscious marketplace. Ikea’s unwavering commitment to sustainability reflects its ability to unlock value creation from society’s evolving priorities. Whether addressing consumer pushback, adopting renewable energy, or embracing circularity, Ikea shows resilience is rooted in the willingness to adapt, evolve, and lead from purpose.7. Unify Cross-FunctionallySiloed efforts lead to inconsistency; champion a collaborative approach across marketing, PR, HR, operations, and, yes, even finance and bring the C-suite and potentially the Board alongside to ensure a harmonized front and standing stronger together. Integrated efforts help organizations adapt effectively to external pressures while fostering coherence across teams and initiatives.Establishing multi-functional Brand/Purpose Councils effectively aligns teams and initiatives, fosters coherence and resilience, and increases operational effectiveness and financial efficiencies.The Path Forward: An Invitation To MarketersOutrage isn’t simply rejecting purpose, sustainability, DEI or even taking a stand. It’s an invitation to reimagine brand leadership. We can see fractured trust as a call to step back or as a chance to move forward more intentionally with purpose, cautiously and bravely, not recklessly.The choices we each make today shape tomorrow. Will you let public frustration and anger drown out possibility, or will you seize this moment to lead with courage, clarity and purpose? The future isn’t waiting; brand leaders are shaping it right now. And in choosing courage and clarity, we can turn outrage into trust—and trust into enduring success.Contributed to Branding Strategy Insider by: Anne Bahr Thompson, AuthorDo Good, Embracing Brand Citizenship to Fuel Both Purpose and Profit.AtThe Blake Project, we help clients worldwide, in all stages of development, define orredefine and articulate what makes them competitive at critical moments of change.

Recognising accounting as a STEM field not only enhances financial literacy among innovators but also instils a critical sense of accountability, essential for sustainable growth.Need for steam in STEMTraditionally, accounting has been viewed through a purely financial lens. However, the modern accounting profession increasingly intersects with technology and data analytics, not to speak of risk management, aligning closely with STEM fields. This integration facilitates advanced financial modelling, predictive analytics, and efficient resource management, all of which are vital in today’s data-driven economy. If accounting were part of the STEM portfolio, it would be clear that it is a pathway to putting high-level technical skills to practical use.Enhancing entrepreneurial success in STEMIndia’s entrepreneurial ecosystem is witnessing a surge in STEM-related start-ups, ranging from biotechnology to information technology. While these ventures are often rich in innovation, they may stumble on the financial acumen necessary for long-term success. Integrating accounting education into STEM curricula can bridge this gap, equipping entrepreneurs with the skills to manage finances effectively, assess economic viability, and make informed strategic decisions. This fusion ensures that technological innovations are supported by sound financial planning, increasing the likelihood of sustainable success.Accounting in an environment of dynamic pricingIn an era where dynamic pricing has become the norm across industries from e-commerce and ride-hailing services to airline ticketing and renewable energy, accounting plays a crucial role in strategic decision-making for STEM entrepreneurs. The ability to analyse cost structures, determine break-even points, and assess marginal costs is essential for businesses operating in volatile pricing environments. Knowledge of accounting empowers entrepreneurs to optimise pricing strategies based on real-time financial data, ensuring profitability while remaining competitive. By integrating cost accounting principles with data analytics, start-ups can make informed decisions on pricing elasticity, discounting strategies, and revenue optimisation. This financial acumen not only helps businesses stay agile but also fosters long-term sustainability in a rapidly evolving marketplace.Promoting accountability and governanceIncorporating accounting into STEM education fosters a culture of accountability. Entrepreneurs trained in accounting principles are better prepared to implement transparent financial practices, adhere to regulatory requirements, and build trust with investors and stakeholders. This accountability is crucial in mitigating risks and maintaining the integrity of business operations.Entrepreneurs today operate in an environment where external financing, whether through debt or equity, is not just an option but a necessity for scaling their businesses. However, with increasing reliance on external funding comes heightened scrutiny from investors, lenders, and regulatory authorities. Equity investors demand transparency in financial reporting to assess the viability of their investments, while lenders require assurance that financial obligations can be met. As financial transactions grow in complexity, so do accounting standards and compliance requirements, making it imperative for entrepreneurs to have a strong grasp of financial discipline. Adhering to recognised accounting principles and regulatory norms is no longer a procedural formality but a fundamental expectation that determines access to capital, investor confidence, and long-term credibility.Despite the enormous potential of many start-ups, failure to meet these expectations has led to serious consequences. In recent years, several high-profile startups in India have suffered significant setbacks due to governance failures and financial mismanagement. Byju’s, once a dominant player in the edtech sector, found itself entangled in financial controversies, including delayed reporting, misaligned growth projections, and concerns over fund utilisation, all of which contributed to a drastic erosion of investor trust.BharatPe, a promising fintech company, saw leadership disputes expose deeper governance flaws, raising red flags about internal controls and accountability. Zilingo, a fashion e-commerce startup, collapsed under allegations of financial misrepresentation, leading to the ousting of its CEO and eventual business failure. GoMechanic, an automotive service start-up, admitted to inflating revenue figures, triggering a crisis that resulted in mass layoffs and investor exits. Similarly, Mojocare, a health and wellness start-up, came under scrutiny for financial irregularities that further underscored the need for rigorous compliance frameworks.These references serve as a stark reminder that financial missteps, whether intentional or due to negligence, can derail even the most promising ventures. Investors, regulators, and other stakeholders now expect start-ups to maintain not only innovative business models but also sound financial discipline. The ability to navigate complex accounting standards and compliance requirements is no longer optional but a prerequisite for survival in an increasingly scrutinised start-up ecosystem. As the funding environment becomes more selective, entrepreneurs who prioritise financial transparency and governance will stand a far better chance of securing capital, sustaining investor confidence, and ultimately building businesses that last.The growing importance of ESG considerationsEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors are becoming central to business evaluations, not to speak of taxation issues, worldwide. In India, regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) have proposed expanding the sustainable finance framework, emphasising the need for comprehensive ESG reporting. Accountants play a pivotal role in this context by identifying relevant metrics, developing measurement methodologies, and ensuring the accuracy of ESG disclosures. Their expertise ensures that companies not only comply with regulations but also contribute positively to societal goals.As India continues to advance in STEM fields, recognising accounting as an integral component of this framework is imperative. This recognition will equip entrepreneurs and professionals with the financial expertise necessary to navigate complex business landscapes, uphold accountability, and meet evolving ESG standards. By embracing accounting within the STEM paradigm, India can foster a more holistic approach to education and business, driving innovation that is both economically viable and socially responsible.(The writer is Partner, RVKS & Associates)CommentsSHARECopy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on  February 11, 2025Related Topicsentrepreneurshipeducationchartered accountancycost and works accountancy"

SUSTAINABLE GREEN BOND INVESTMENTS FOR CAPITAL MARKETS (Jignesh Kapadia),"{'id': None, 'name': 'Finextra'}",https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/27882/sustainable-green-bond-investments-for-capital-markets,"In today’s constantly changing world, global challenges, and business landscape there are many challenges that the leaders and organizations must go through. For the Financial Services industry it presents new orincreasing risks for investors, such as climate risk, increased regulatory pressures, social and demographic shifts, privacy, and data security concerns. Moreover, consumers and stakeholders increasingly demand more environmental, social, and
 governance transparency, with organizations expected to provide accountability on their sustainability efforts. Brand loyalty increasingly pivots on this transparency. Changing government regulations around the world also reinforce the need to focus on sustainability—to
 continue doing business, organizations must meet emissions reduction on targets across different geographies. So far, the global approach to sustainability has largely been about damage control, with businesses le􀅌 to develop their own approaches.This blog describes the futuristics ESG initiatives (Sustainable Green Bonds) within Capital Markets space using the emerging technologies to drive the ESG objective and related considerations as a main goal to select investments or funded sustainable
 projects that can help measure and monitor sustainable outcomesIntroductionThe old strategy of focusing solely on profit is no longer enough—to produce real value, companies need to reinvent themselves, moving beyond a pursuit of profit alone to establish a belief and purpose that defines their existence. Reimagining
 business models to address long-term sustainability challenges is truly entrepreneurial and world changing. By successfully transitioning from a shareholder capitalist system to a stakeholder capitalist system, businesses will better be able to use a belief
 and purpose-led growth strategy that benefits employees, communities, consumers, investors, and society at large.TrendsESG is moving from the boundary to the mainstream, transforming the capital and finance market. Investors are demanding assets that have sustainable growth. They are looking at the businesses’ commitment to sustainability before making their investment
 decisions. US Sustainable assets almost doubled every 3 years since 2016 e.g., $87B – $155B (2016-2019) & $155B – $250 B (2019-2022). Although, the reporting measures on the environmental impact of investments are still lagging is facing huge challenges.ChallengesThe global transformation in capital and finance market has a higher traction in Europe as compared to other Geos driven by EU Climate policies and Green deals. Many companies want to take advantage of this momentum to finance themselves sustainably. At
 the same time, they are not familiar with ESG- investment specific requirements and market standards.ImplicationsThese new transformations will have the following impacts on the business.Cost Impact – The investment bank may have to share their part of the underwriting fee with third party authority. They may also not know how to price this cost as there is no playbook to price an event based on environmental set-up.Revenue Impact – The revenue will increase since automated data collection using emerging technologies will result in a drastic reduction in reporting cost.Operations Impact - Need to find a dedicated team of sustainable finance experts who can structure deals and covenants.Solutions & BenefitsThe environmental data that will be monitored are sourced from IOT liked sensors linked to Blockchain to create an immutable temper proof ledger. Environmental agreements (e.g. CO2 emissions, net energy use) are also smart contracts,
 so that covenant events can be triggered based on readings from IOT sensors. The Ledger is stored in cloud and accessible by all parties. AI algorithms can help on data authentication, predictive analytics and forecasting on contract advances or breaches.Benefits of these type of futuristic solutions aligns with the trends mentioned below:Demand for sustainable investments is growing among all investor classes including institutional investors:In 2019 more than $250B of green bonds were written representing 51% growth in year-over-year increases in signaling investors demand for this asset class.Regulatory requirements and government incentives are evolving for green investments:EU’s taxonomy regulation is rigorously defining “green investments” standards. In the US under clean renewable energy bond program, 70% of coupons are paid for by tax credit or subsidy. In China ESG disclosures are becoming mandatory for public companies.Even with few uncertainties and not matured processes, sustainable investments wave has already become the largest and fastest growing major market segment. Any delay in getting engaged will have an impact on market penetration.According to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, at the start of 2016, sustainable investments constituted 26 percent of assets that are professionally managed in Asia, Australia and New Zealand,Canada, Europe, and the United States—$22.89
 trillion in total. Four years earlier, they were 21.5 percent of assets.The most widely applied sustainable investment strategy globally for two-thirds of sustainable investments is negative screening. ESG integration, which is the systematic and explicit inclusion of ESG factors in financial analysis is now growing
 17% per year and used with nearly half of sustainable investments.Green Investment ApproachesThe customers have taken multiple approaches towards process improvements in sustainable investing to identify the likelihood of the impact, positive or negative, known or unknown, direct or indirect on any of the ESG dimensions.First is the identification of the Goals out of the 17 SDGs that are attributable to the operations of the company with respect to its areas of operations, geography presence, Customers business operations and vulnerability to ESG impacts, company’s supply
 chain processes of and by its vendors etc. It is the holistic view that one needs to understand to ensure the impact on ESG is negated and not only contribute to net-zero impact but to generate positive net-gain to the ESG dimensions.Second is the technologies available in the market to leverage help measure and monitor the operations in the entire cycle from Supply Chain to internal processes to Customer operations and ensure the right level of CO2 emissions and net energy are captured
 to assess correct level of Green Bond covenants.A sustainable investment blueprint that leverages technology to ensure systematic, transparent, traceable execution will help the financial services company to achieve their ESG goals. The key elements are:Capturing level 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions like travel data, energy consumption, datacentre Energy Consumption and Calculate Emission Factors.Intelligent insights to identify energy saving opportunities and impactful environment projects.Ecosystem tracking and analysis by assessing sustainability of companies throughout the business ecosystem, value chain, supply chain, M&A pool to ensure alignment with green values.Shortcomings to ApproachesThe ESG dimensions are not construed to be providing the direct benefit on top-line or bottom-line of the operations in monetary terms and the benefit of these are not seen in early days, it becomes challenging to formulate these and follow right
 through the organizations. It needs to be inculcated in each individual within the organizations and within all its partners, associates and workers at all levels. It is imperative that these are recognized well in time and adhered. Overcoming these challenges
 require the mindset change – not only due to regulatory reasons but to cater to the universe at large, to prevent humanity and bio-dversity at large. Leverage systems and experts knowledge to baseline the objectives to achieve the goal of contibuting net-gain.ConclusionSustainable investing is becoming the core strategic driver giving a competitive advantage to organizations, especially as traditional linear business models continue to get disrupted due to market forces and the increasing effects of climate
 change. Although no one has the answers on how climate disruptions will ultimately play out, a holistic, a green bond investment based on collaboration and innovation will provide the most potential to move from a mitigation approach to one of regeneration.The proposed futuristic solution explained in section 1.5 above and many others, provide thought leadership for banking and financial services companies by engaging early in providing sustainable solutions to their Customers. By spearheadng showcasing early
 adoption will get them a high reputation which in turn will generate excellent brand value.Glossery & References-TermsDescriptionsESGEnvironment, Society and GovernanceSDGSustainable Development GoalsFIFinancial ServicesGRIGlobal Reporting InitiativeSASBSustainability Accounting Standards BoardTCFDTask Force and Climate related financial DisclosuresEUEuropean UnionUSUnited StatesBaker Mackenzie (2019) -https://www.bakermckenzie.com/Climate Bond Initiatives–https://www.climatebonds.net/resources/reports/2019-green-bond-market-summary.Harvard Business Review -https://hbr.org/2019/05/the-investor-revolution"

Here’s why capital is fleeing Europeâ¦ And why the climate scam is to blame,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Naturalnews.com'}",https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-02-18-heres-why-capital-is-fleeing-europe.html,"(Article by Chris MacIntosh republished fromInternationalMan.com)Consider this:VWâs profits dropped by 64%. Audiâs profits dropped by 91%. BMWâs profits dropped by 84%. And Mercedes-Benzâs profits dropped by 54%.German carmakers are in trouble. Their business model was based on two things: cheap Russian energy powering the German engineering coupled with sales in China subsidizing antiquated, overblown unions protecting their cost structure at home. The first pillar collapsed and the second is now under severe pressure.China now builds its own decent cars. Thereâs no need for the Chinese to buy anything other than Chinese cars.Now, let me show you something else. The flow of trade, of course, is seen in the currency markets.What youâre looking at above isnât so much the dollar gaining as much as it is the euro losing. Capital is fleeing Euroland â exactly as weâve been promising you it would.Wanna see something else cool?Now, you may look at this and think,ÂâAha, Chrisâ¦ look, itâs the cheapest itâs been in over 30 years.âBut I think Europe is a value trap. Unfortunately, this is not purely business cycle cyclical. This is terminal. I loved Europe. I lived there for years and traveled around it extensively, so believe me I find no pleasure in my diagnosis, but Europe is completely and totally au-pha-cdup, and I donât see it getting much better anytime soon.The other component of this is the US markets, because western capital has always played largely between Europe and North America. So if itâs not Europe, wellâ¦And itâs fueling this.There are many reasons for the US stock market to outperform. Certainly, the collapse of Europe is a major factor in this. It is one reason Iâd be very reluctant to short US stocks, despite their relative and absolute overvaluation.As Energy Goes, So Goes the EconomySolar Firm Collapse Shakes Denmarkâs Financial SystemThe collapse of Denmarkâs Better Energy A/S, a once-hyped solar park developer, is sending repercussions through the Nordic countryâs financial system and bringing eerie reminders of the recent problems for another green energy champion, Northvolt AB, in neighboring Sweden.It was inevitable that the renewable energy scam would finally be exposed. What is worth looking at, though, is the extent of carnage left in the wake of the woke virtue signaling crowd. I have long taken aim at the cowards running large pools of capital. They take home their big paychecks and kowtow to the rainbow people with diversity hires and pronoun nonsense while taking the hard-earned and entrusted capital from average folks and ploughing it into isht that never made any sense. And they did it because theyâre professional weasels!Among those burnt are Sydbank A/S, Denmarkâs third-largest listed lender, which cut its 2024 financial outlook on Thursday and said Better Energyâs collapse could lead to 450 million kroner ($63 million) in impairment charges. Sydbank shares tanked as much as 8% in Copenhagen, the biggest one-day drop since March.Denmarkâs biggest pension fund, ATP, which owns about 15% of Better Energy, will lose a three digit million-krone amount, a company spokesperson told Bloomberg. ATP invested 696 million kroner in 2022, Better Energyâs earnings report for that year shows. ATP said earlier this week itâs taking a major hit on its 2.3 billion-krone stake in troubled battery maker Northvolt, in which the Danish pension fund was one of the largest owners with a stake of about 5%.It is one thing losing your own money and risking it in some new fad. These muppets running the pension fund should be immediately fired and ridiculed. But you know what? They wonât! They will keep their cushy jobs and pensioners will simply get hosed.Itâs a very disappointing situation,â ATPâs head of Danish equities, Claus Wiinblad, said in emailed comments. âBetter Energy has found itself in a situation where the shareholdersâ money canât be saved.No, itâs not âdisappointing,â you moron. It is and always was entirely predictable. If youâd pulled your rainbow coloured head out of your ass, spent more time on the business and financials and less on your absurd ESG ratings, you wouldnât be in this situation and â more importantly â your clients wouldnât be facing steep losses.NY at the Pointy End of the Climate CatastrophistsThe pointy shoes are getting more and more desperate.New York state will fine fossil fuel companies a total of $75 billion over the next 25 years to pay for damage caused to the climate under a bill Governor Kathy Hochul signed into law on Thursday.You know whatâs going to happen, right? Capital will simply leave New York, and the local government will seek to fill the collapsing revenue gap with higher taxes, which itself will see more folks with the ability to leave and the already dangerous and dirty New York will get worse.Imposing Ideology Brings ConflictCase in pointâ¦Qatar has threatened to stop vital gas shipments to the EU if member states strictly enforce new legislation that will penalise companies which fail to meet set criteria on carbon emissions, human and labour rights. Qatari energy minister Saad al-Kaabi told the Financial Times that if any EU state imposed non-compliance penalties on a scale referenced in the corporate due diligence directive Doha would stop exporting its liquefied natural gas to the bloc.This legislature is bad for the EU, but theyâre already screwedâ¦ which is why they now import most of their energy (because it is impossible to do business within the EU). What this legislature basically does is it says that all EU-based companies (already a given) and ALL foreign (non-EU based) companies (such as Qatar) doing business with the EU must adhere to EU rules in all global operations or they will be fined up to 5% of their total global revenues.Companies must adopt and put into effect a transition plan for climate change mitigation aligned with the Paris Agreement and the 2050 climate neutrality objective, including intermediate targets under the European Climate Law.Qatar will simply prioritise doing business with the global south, and Europe will be left without energy.Editorâs Note: The Western system is undergoing substantial changes, and the signs of moral decay, corruption, and increasing debt are impossible to ignore. With the Great Reset in motion, the United Nations, World Economic Forum, IMF, WHO, World Bank, and Davos man are all promoting a unified agenda that will affect us all.To get ahead of the chaos, download our free PDF report âClash of the Systems: Thoughts on Investing at a Unique Point in Timeâ byÂclicking here.Read more at:ÂInternationalMan.com"

Last year, the regulator had mandated environment, social and governance (ESG) rating providers to register and obtain an ERP license.In the subscriber-pays model, ERPs can withdraw a rating if there are no subscribers for the rating.

Once the rating is withdrawn, it has to be withdrawn for all subscribers, SEBI clarified.ERPs with the issuer-pays model can only withdraw a rating after continuously three years of rating the security, or half way through the security’s tenure—whichever is higher. However, this is subject to receiving approval from 75 per cent of the bondholders by value.Further, SEBI has proposed that ERPs following a subscriber-pays model should share detailed rating rationales and reports only with subscribers and not publish on their websites.

Our products and services solutions enable companies to collect, evaluate and share sustainability data through easy-to-use software. DSL’s principal executive office is in Hong Kong where the CEO, CFO and CTO are based. The Hong Kong office is in a co-working shared space facility with 9 seats and the Hong Kong based employees operate under a hybrid model as they work both from the office and from home with the majority of working hours spent working from home. There is also an executive office in Monaco that is used by the Chairman and COO. DSL has subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and United States, however the subsidiary in the United States is inactive. DSL also outsources a component of IT development and maintenance support to engineers in Vietnam. DSL has built several accessible, affordable and intelligent products to help democratize sustainability and offers multiple supporting services to complement the product suite. DSL’s suite of products includes the following: digninexESG: is an accredited Hong Kong Monetary Authority award winning cloud based ESG platform that offers end to end reporting from topic discovery, data collection to collaborative report publishing. Our diginexESG platform is ISO-27001 Certified (an international standard to manage information security), official partner of Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), World Economic Forum and signatory of the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment (UN PRI). The diginexESG platform guides companies through the entire ESG journey; from materiality assessment & stakeholder engagement, framework & indicator selection, the data collection and collaboration process, report creation, validation and ultimately report publishing. By leveraging machine learning and data analytics, diginexESG is able to drive material efficiencies in the reporting process, and the blockchain-enabled audit trail, whereby a record of each data activity is created and stored on a blockchain, provides greater transparency in the data thus increasing its value. Originally targeted specially at Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) around the world who are new to ESG reporting and lack the budget or bandwidth to engage with traditional and often expensive consultants, diginexESG has increased its feature set to include functionality that also targets larger companies with more complex organizational structures. diginexESG has also been adopted by global commercial banks like HSBC to help engage with their diverse customer base at scale. diginexLUMEN: allows companies to execute comprehensive supply chain risk assessments about working conditions within the supply chain. Supplier information is validated against worker feedback and automated risk calculations enables companies to prioritize issues for mitigation and prevention of adverse impacts and improvement efforts. diginexLUMEN focuses on broad data collection through complex inter-jurisdictional supply chains with a specific focus on social governance issues such as forced labor due diligence, gender risk and child labor risk. Through the collection of data from suppliers and validation by workers, diginexLUMEN relies on proprietary algorithms to generate risk scores to help companies identify which parts of their supply chain require greater scrutiny. The platform then auto-generates corrective action plans which allow the brands and suppliers to work together to remedy potentially problematic areas and reduce the risk score. diginexAPPRISE: is a multilingual application that collects standardized, actionable data related to working conditions directly from workers in global supply chains. Through tailored question sets, companies can deploy surveys directly to workers in their supply chain on a variety of topics such as responsible recruitment, gender equality and pulse check living and working conditions. The worker voice tool was initially developed by the United Nations University Institute in Macau (UNU-IIST) in partnership with The Mekong Club – an organization working with the private sector to bring about sustainable practices against modern slavery, and was acquired by DSL on December 14, 2021. diginexAPPRISE is available both as a standalone tool and also fully integrated into diginexLUMEN. diginexCLIMATE: is a proprietary carbon footprint calculator based on the GHG protocols that is currently available as an integrated part of the diginexESG platform. This allows companies to seamlessly calculate their Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon footprint as part of their overall ESG reporting journey. Scope 1 are those direct emissions that are owned or controlled by a company, whereas scopes 2 and 3 indirect emissions are the result of the activities of the company but occur from sources not owned or controlled by it. DSL also offers the following complementary services: diginexADVISORY: is a service offered by DSL as a complement to the suite of DSL software license sales. diginexADVISORY provides clients strategy and advisory support at every stage of the sustainability journey, including assurance solutions for credible reporting. We also offer custom framework creation for clients who need more complex reporting templates or who want to set a benchmark for others in their industry. As part of diginexADVISORY we also develop and run one-off or programmatic training sessions covering a range of topics from a general introduction to ESG to complex carbon accounting and emissions. diginexPARTNERS: is a service whereby DSL develops white label versions of both diginexESG and diginexLUMEN for companies who then want to run either diginexESG or diginexLUMEN as an extension of their own service offering. This service often requires custom technology work up front for our clients that generates initial revenue as well as ongoing service and maintenance licenses which generate ongoing recurring revenue. In addition, DSL develops custom software platforms as part of a project consortiums for organizations like the United States Department of State, United States Department of Labor, and the United Nations. diginexMANAGEDSERVICES: is service to be offered by DSL to provide oversight and support to clients in operationalizing the roll out of our software products within their organizational structure or supplier base. This service can include training and education, onboarding, data collection and analysis, as well as general on-going support.

This sustained growth, amounting to a CAGR of 4.3%, underscores the burgeoning demand for clean and healthy indoor environments across a variety of sectors.The report includes:19 data tables and 51 additional tablesAn updated overview and in-depth analysis of the U.S. market for indoor air quality (IAQ) products and servicesAnalyses of the market trends, with sales data for 2023, estimates for 2024, forecasts for 2025, 2027, and projections of compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) through 2029Estimation of the actual market size and revenue forecasts for the U.S. indoor air quality market, and corresponding market share analysis by type, product segments, end-use industry, and regionDiscussion of the major factors driving the growth of IAQ industry, history and importance, market trends and environment, regulatory concerns, and the effects of IAQ contaminantsAnalysis of the market opportunities with a holistic study of Porter's Five Forces model and supply chain analysis of the IAQ industry considering both the micro and macro environmental factors prevailing in the marketplaceInsight into the recent industry structure for indoor air quality market, government regulations and standards, key development issues, and the vendor landscape and operational integrationAnalysis of the key patent grants and intellectual property aspects of the marketA discussion on ESG challenges and practices of the industryCompetitive landscape featuring the leading manufacturers of IAQ products in U.S., their current ranking and company share analysis, along with the latest key developments within the industryProfiles of the leading market players, including Carrier, Daikin Industries Ltd., Honeywell International Inc., Johnson Controls and Trane Technologies Plc.The EPA's Science Advisory Board has consistently ranked indoor air pollution among the top five environmental risks to public health. Poor IAQ is one of the top major public health risks, and it is largely unregulated by federal and most state governments. More than 50 organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), across 38 countries, have established IAQ guidelines. For instance, in February 2024, the EPA strengthened the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM) 2.5 micrometers and smaller (PM2.5) to 9.0 ?g/m to provide increased public health protection.In the U.S., poor IAQ can be caused by humidity levels, inadequate ventilation, pets, dust, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In general, the most effective method to enhance IAQ is to mitigate pollution sources or reduce household emissions, increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside through improved ventilation systems, and use appropriate air cleaners. Also, changing air conditioning filters, maintaining air ducts, using cooking vents, maintaining humidity, using high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, and using air purifiers can improve air quality in indoor spaces.Several air purifiers can eliminate indoor air pollutants. Air pollutants can be detected with more precise, efficient and compact sensors using environmental sensing technology. Soon, indoor air pollution may also be controlled through nanotechnology, which works by trapping or destroying indoor contaminants on a molecular level. For instance, in July 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an additional 510(k) clearance to Kronos Advanced Technologies Inc.'s flagship product, Kronos Model 8, classifying it as a Class II Medical Device. It utilizes patented High Voltage Field air disinfection technology that can remove contaminants and allergens up to 14.6 nanometers (0.0146 microns), which is 20 times smaller than HEPA filters.Key Attributes:Report AttributeDetailsNo. of Pages119Forecast Period2024 - 2029Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024$10.5 BillionForecasted Market Value (USD) by 2029$12.9 BillionCompound Annual Growth Rate4.3%Regions CoveredUnited StatesKey Topics Covered:Chapter 1 Executive SummaryMarket OutlookScope of ReportMarket SummaryMarket Dynamics and GrowthSegmental AnalysisRegional Insights and Emerging MarketsChapter 2 Market OverviewMarket Overview and Future ScenariosSupply Chain AnalysisRaw Material SuppliersComponent ProvidersTechnology and Systems IntegratorsIAQ ManufacturersEnd UsersPorter's Five Forces Analysis for the U.S. IAQ MarketMacro-Economic Factors AnalysisU.S. Per Capita Spending on HealthU.S. Gross Domestic ProductGrowing Investment in the Construction SectorRegulatory OutlookClean Air ActBuilding Codes and CertificationsRecent Developments in Regulatory FrameworkProspects in RegulationsCase Studies for IAQ Projects in the U.S.City of Oviedo Healthy BuildingsRichmond School District, WisconsinChapter 3 Market DynamicsMarket DriversSupportive Government Regulations for IAQConsumer Awareness of the need for IAQ ProductsIncrease in Indoor Air PollutionMarket RestraintsInitial Cost of IAQ ProductsLack of StandardizationMarket OpportunitiesTechnological Developments in IAQ ProductsExpansion of the Industrial SectorMarket TrendsSmart Technologies for Monitoring IAQSupportive Investments and Program GrantsShort- and Long-Term Impacts of Market DynamicsChapter 4 Emerging Technologies and DevelopmentsEmerging Technologies/ApplicationsHome Automation for Improving Air QualityAdvances in Air Purification TechnologiesIntegration of IoT in IAQ ProductsIntegration of AI and MLPatent AnalysisOverviewKey PatentsTakeawaysChapter 5 Market Segmentation AnalysisU.S. IAQ Market, by TypeEquipmentServicesU.S. IAQ Market, by Product TypeAir PurifiersHumidifiersVentilation SystemsAir FiltersDehumidifiersUltraviolet LampsCarbon Monoxide AlarmsU.S. IAQ Market, by End-Use IndustryResidentialCommercialIndustrialOthersGeographic BreakdownU.S. IAQ Market, by RegionChapter 6 Competitive IntelligenceMarket Share AnalysisCompany Strategy and Product Portfolio MatrixProduct Mapping AnalysisStrategy and Financial Performance AnalysisRecent DevelopmentsChapter 7 Sustainability in the U.S. IAQ Market: An ESG PerspectiveEnvironmental ImpactSocial ImpactGovernance ImpactStatus of ESG in the U.S. IAQ IndustryCase Study: Examples of Successful Implementation of ESGHoneywell International Inc.Johnson ControlsCarrierConsumer Attitudes Towards ESGCompanies ProfiledAprilaireBeyond by AerusBlueairCamfilCarrierDaikin Industries Ltd.Honeywell International Inc.Johnson ControlsLennox International Inc.Mann+HummelPanasonic Corp.RectorsealRGF Environmental Group Inc.Rheem Manufacturing Co.Trane TechnologiesFor more information about this report visithttps://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/87u3grAbout ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Fund managers play a crucial role in channeling institutional capital into green finance, driven by regulatory mandates, investor preferences, and long-term risk-adjusted returns associated with green bonds. Additionally, the rising adoption of green investment strategies among pension funds, mutual funds, and asset management firms has strengthened the demand for green bonds. The introduction of sustainability-linked investment funds and dedicated green bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has further accelerated participation from fund managers. Moreover, the diversification benefits, stable yields, and risk mitigation attributes of green bonds have made them attractive to institutional investors. With global commitments toward net-zero targets and expanding green finance frameworks, fund managers are expected to maintain a dominant position in thegreen bonds marketin the coming years.The corporate segment tomaintainits lead position during the forecast periodBy issuer, the corporate segment accounted for the largest share in 2023, owing to the growing emphasis on sustainability commitments, ESG integration, and corporate decarbonization targets. Companies across industries, particularly in energy, utilities, transportation, and real estate, have been increasingly issuing green bonds to finance renewable energy projects, energy-efficient infrastructure, and carbon reduction initiatives. Furthermore, investor demand for sustainable corporate debt instruments has encouraged businesses to leverage green bonds as a cost-effective financing tool while enhancing their corporate reputation and ESG ratings. The availability of green finance incentives, such as tax benefits and lower capital costs, has also driven higher issuance levels. Additionally, regulatory frameworks like the EU Green Bond Standard and ICMA’s Green Bond Principles have facilitated transparency and credibility, making it easier for corporates to tap into the green bond market. With rising sustainability pressures, corporate green bond issuances are expected to maintain strong momentum.The energy segment tomaintainits lead position during the forecast periodBy application, the energy segment accounted for the largest share in 2023, owing to the growing global transition toward renewable energy sources and the urgent need for decarbonization. Green bonds have become a key financing tool for large-scale investments in solar, wind, hydro, and other renewable energy projects, enabling governments and corporations to achieve net-zero targets and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, favorable policies and subsidies promoting clean energy adoption, along with commitments under international agreements like the Paris Climate Accord, have accelerated funding through green bonds. The expansion of smart grids, energy storage solutions, and carbon capture technologies has further contributed to high capital requirements, driving increased green bond issuance in the energy sector. Moreover, institutional investors prioritize climate-resilient infrastructure and sustainable energy investments due to their long-term stability and risk-adjusted returns, reinforcing the dominance of the energy segment in the green bonds market.Get More Information Before Buying:https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchase-enquiry/A325534Europe region dominated the market in 2023By region, Europe held the highest market share in terms of revenue in 2023, owing to strong regulatory support, well-established sustainability frameworks, and high investor demand for green finance. The European Union’s Green Bond Standard (EU GBS) and Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) have played a crucial role in promoting transparency and credibility in green bond issuances. Additionally, European governments and corporations have actively issued green bonds to finance renewable energy, clean transportation, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Countries like Germany, France, and the Netherlands have led sovereign and corporate green bond issuances, reinforcing Europe’s leadership in sustainable finance. The European Central Bank’s (ECB) support for green investments, coupled with growing ESG-driven institutional investor participation, has further fueled market growth.

The company told employees that the ""legal and policy landscape"" around DEI efforts in the US was changing.Other companies that have rolled back programs includeGoogle, which said this month that it would no longer pursue hiring goals based on DEI, andAmazon, which has changed references about DEI benefits on some of its websites.Though some companies began shifting focus away from DEI before the election, several tech leaders have recently reacted to President Donald Trump's deeming DEI efforts ""wasteful.""Apple's decision to stand by its DEI policies could weigh on its relationship with the president.CEO Tim Cookhas tried to build a good rapport with Trump, visiting his Mar-a-Lago resort in December.On Monday,Apple announced a plan to hire about 20,000 peopleover the next four years as part of a commitment to invest more than $500 billion in US projects.Apple is a rare holdout among tech firms stepping back from DEI initiatives.

Why Tom Steyer Is Betting That Climate Action Is Still Good Business,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",https://time.com/7260407/tom-steyer-climate-action-good-business/,"ByJustin WorlandFebruary 21, 2025 11:32 AM ESTNews about how investors are responding to climate change can look pretty grim these days.Opportunities in AI have taken up a lot of the oxygen—and capital—in the financial sector, and  the Trump Administration’s move to rip up anything climate related has pushed some investors to turn their backs on climate deals.If these developments have you down, consider looking to Tom Steyer for a pick-me-up.Steyer, known by many as a 2020 presidential candidate, has since returned to his finance roots—this time as an investor focused on climate change. When we caught up earlier this month at his office in San Francisco, he brushed aside questions about how the new Trump Administration, and the broader climate pullback it has inspired, might challenge his business. He’s focused on economics, and in his telling the financial side of the equation remains solid.“I would say the numbers about the ability to make this transition are much better than expected,” he tells me, citing the continued record deployment of clean energy technologies. “The rhetoric moves back and forth, but ultimately the facts drive home reality.”His firm, Galvanize Climate Solutions, has focused in three categories: equities, real estate, and venture and growth. In those areas, the Galvanize team looks for investments that advance the climate cause while generating above market returns—all without relying on policy support from Washington. “This is going to happen if, in fact, we win in the marketplace,” he says. “We're not getting subsidies, we're not getting free money from the government, and we're not counting on anybody being nice.”Read More:Here Are All of Trump’s Major Moves to Dismantle Climate ActionTake real estate. Galvanize pairs general expertise on the real estate sector with knowledge of the financial opportunities that can come from decarbonizing real estate assets—think of lower costs as a result of energy efficiency and on-site renewable energy. That in turn drives up the price of the asset. “It's just understanding technology, understanding costs, understanding buildings and real estate markets,” he says.Steyer is not the only investor sticking with climate, though few are likely to be as full throated in still making their case or as steadfast in their determination. Some big financial institutions have insisted they will continue to pursue deals that advance the climate agenda when the economics pencil out.But there’s no question that the general enthusiasm that made anything climate-related hot a few years ago has dissipated—and troublingly for climate advocates, the enthusiasm was already waning before the Trump Administration took office in January. Areportfrom PitchBook, which tracks private-market investment data, found that total venture funding for climate-tech fell for the third year in a row last year with funding down more than 17% from the year prior. In the public markets, U.S. ESG funds experienced outflows every quarter last year, according to areportfrom investment research firm Morningstar.And yet Steyer argues that the zeitgeist shift around sustainable investing makes this a great time to be a climate investor. At the core of Steyer’s argument is an assessment of the supply and demand for capital. Right now, he says, there are more investment-grade opportunities in climate and decarbonization than capital available to make those investments. This, he argues, translates into a wide range of opportunities to pick from and better deal terms for investors willing to take the leap. “From the standpoint of an investor, that's a good thing,” he says. “From the standpoint of the country or the world, that's probably not a good thing.”Over the years, I’ve had a chance to chat with Steyer on several occasions, especially during his political phase. And yet this feels like his most important environmental work. When it comes to convincing the private sector to stick with climate, he tells me, “success is the best argument.”"

Three Golden Rules For Integrating Profit And Purpose,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/nelldebevoise/2025/02/23/three-golden-rules-for-integrating-profit-and-purpose/,"LeadershipLeadership StrategyThree Golden Rules For Integrating Profit And PurposeByNell Derick Debevoise, Senior Contributor.My Lead in 3D framework helps leaders reach Me, We, and World goals.Follow AuthorFeb 23, 2025, 11:15am ESTSave ArticleCommentIn today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, success is no longer measured solely by quarterly earnings. Increasingly, senior corporate leaders are challenged to balance the drive for material gain with the imperative to create positive impact—while diligently minimizing any negative fallout. Integrating profit and purpose means aligning your bottom line with broader, long-term benefits to society and the environment.For leaders navigating the anti-ESG narrative, this approach is a cornerstone of values-based leadership and responsible capitalism. It’s about asking: “How can we do well by doing good?” And in the spirit of looking beyond the immediate balance sheet, here are three golden rules to get you started: Zoom Out, Slow Down, and Look to Nature.1. Zoom Out: Embrace the Bigger PictureToo often, our calculations are myopic—focusing only on direct costs and immediate returns. Yet, in the grand tapestry of business, every transaction, supply chain decision, or strategic pivot has far-reaching consequences. Zooming out means considering all stakeholders involved: employees, customers, communities, and the environment. It’s a call to widen our lens to capture externalities that traditional metrics overlook—a critical step for leaders navigating ESG criticism and the anti-ESG landscape.Take Seventh Generation as a prime example. This company has built its brand on a holistic perspective, prioritizing environmental health and social responsibility alongside profit. By meticulously accounting for the environmental and social costs (and benefits) of its cleaning products, Seventh Generation has demonstrated that a broader view can unearth hidden value.Their approach isn’t just ethical—it’s a smart long-term business strategy that champions responsible capitalism. Similarly, Unilever’s Sustainable Living Plan pushes corporations to factor in not only financial returns but also societal impact. When Unilever considered the broader implications of its business, it reaped benefits that went far beyond immediate profits, ultimately creating a resilient model that appeals to both consumers and investors.But the wisdom of a broad perspective isn’t confined to the cleaning aisle or personal care. Look at Danone—a global leader in the food and beverage sector—redefining value by investing in sustainable agriculture and community-driven initiatives. Danone’s strategy goes beyond profit margins to nurture local ecosystems and ensure the health of communities, proving that food for thought can be both nutritious and nurturing.Similarly, IKEA, the Swedish furniture giant, has taken the idea of zooming out to heart. Beyond assembling affordable flat-pack furniture, IKEA is a champion of renewable energy, sustainable sourcing, and circular design. By considering the full lifecycle of its products—from responsibly sourced raw materials to creative recycling programs—IKEA reminds us that every screw and plank can contribute to a more sustainable future. This broader perspective not only aligns with values-based leadership but also offers a robust counterpoint to anti-ESG sentiments, showcasing how profit and purpose can coexist.In short, when we zoom out, the math may look grim at a glance—but a comprehensive view reveals that investments which seem expensive today might actually serve customers better, unlock new business opportunities, or even save money in the long run. As any landscape photographer knows, a zoomed-out view often reveals the beauty of the entire picture, not just a single tree.Ensure you're not missing the purpose of the forest for the profit of a single tree.getty2. Slow Down: Prioritize Long-Term Vision Over Short-Term HypeModern business practices have been shaped by the relentless demands of quarterly reporting and algorithmic trading. This hyper-focus on short-term metrics has fostered a culture that values speed over substance. Yet, as history has shown, companies that rush tend to burn out—Fortune 500 companies have witnessed their lifespans shrink dramatically over recent decades, a sobering reminder of the costs of haste.Slowing down is about taking the time to deliberate and plan, focusing on the long view rather than reacting to the next quarterly headline. It means building a strategy that aligns with a more human—or earthly—time scale.Consider Interface Carpet, a company that reimagined its entire business model through a deliberate, slow transformation toward sustainability. By resisting the temptation to chase short-term gains and instead investing in long-term environmental innovation, Interface not only reduced its ecological footprint but also revitalized itsbrand. Their journey is a compelling example of how embracing responsible capitalism can drive profitability while challenging the anti-ESG narrative.The decision to slow down can also be seen in the actions ofUnilever. While the pressure to deliver immediate financial results is intense, Unilever’s commitment to long-term sustainability has shown that patience pays off. They understand that a strategy centered on slow, thoughtful evolution—rather than knee-jerk reactions to market fluctuations—can lead to a more robust, resilient enterprise.It’s a bit like brewing a fine cup of coffee: a hasty grind might leave you with a weak, unsatisfying blend, whereas a patient, well-considered process delivers something truly rich and fulfilling. For leaders committed to values-based leadership, this shift away from the high-speed demands of modern markets is not just refreshing—it’s essential.Value is not made in a minute: resist the false urgency of algorithmic trading.getty3. Look to Nature: Let the World’s Best Systems Be Your GuideNature has been perfecting sustainable systems for billions of years, and yet it’s often the last source of inspiration in boardrooms and balance sheets. The natural world operates on a simple, yet profound principle: take only what you need, ensuring that every organism—and ecosystem—thrives without depleting its resources. This is the essence of sustainable living, and it should serve as a guiding principle for integrating profit and purpose, especially when facing anti-ESG challenges.Nature has myriad systems to create and distribute value equitably.gettyNespresso provides an illuminating case study here. Faced with the sustainability challenges inherent in coffee production, Nespresso has embarked on ambitious initiatives to ensure that its supply chain mirrors nature’s balanced approach. From sustainable sourcing practices to comprehensive recycling programs, the company strives to reduce its environmental impact while delivering a premium product. By looking to nature, Nespresso illustrates that it’s possible to blend luxury with responsibility, satisfying consumer demand for quality without sacrificing the health of our planet.Interface Carpet, once again, serves as a stellar example. The company’s Mission Zero initiative was inspired in part by nature’s efficiencies, setting out a goal to eliminate any negative environmental impact by mimicking the cycles and balances found in natural ecosystems. By adopting a philosophy of “take only what you need,” Interface not only minimized waste but also uncovered new efficiencies that translated into cost savings—a win for both profit and purpose. This strategy reinforces the ideals of responsible capitalism and stands as a counterweight to anti-ESG criticism by demonstrating that sustainable practices yield measurable business benefits.Nature’s blueprint is clear: sustainability isn’t a buzzword; it’s a time-tested strategy forthriving in a world of finite resources. When businesses mirror these natural processes—taking only what is necessary, reinvesting wisely, and ensuring the well-being of all stakeholders—they create systems that are robust, resilient, and, yes, profitable.The Takeaway: A Balanced, Long-Term Approach to BusinessIntegrating profit and purpose is far from a feel-good add-on; it’s a vital strategy for long-term success in today’s complex market. By zooming out, we ensure that we’re considering every stakeholder and every ripple effect of our decisions. By slowing down, we escape the tyranny of the quarterly and embrace a more sustainable, thoughtful approach to growth. And by looking to nature, we draw on the world’s oldest and most effective blueprint for sustainable living.The path isn’t always easy—after all, short-term pressures and market volatility can be relentless. But as businesses like Seventh Generation, Unilever, Danone, IKEA, Nespresso, and Interface Carpet have shown, aligning profit with purpose can unlock extraordinary value. Their stories serve as powerful case studies for values-based leadership and responsible capitalism, providing a roadmap for leaders determined to navigate the anti-ESG landscape while honoring their values.For senior corporate leaders committed to forging a new path, the call is clear: make strategic decisions that consider the full spectrum of impact. Next time you’re faced with a decision that pits immediate returns against long-term impact, remember: sometimes it pays to zoom out, slow down, and take a page from nature’s playbook. After all, if nature can thrive on a simple rule of balance, why shouldn’t our businesses do the same?Follow me onLinkedIn.Check outmywebsiteorsome of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades"

Mitch McConnell (R-KY).The Kentucky businessman, who founded a waste management company, said that the pressure he received to back ESG policies was like nothing else, noting that the waste management business often has mafia connections, citing the hit television show theSopranos.“I’ve never seen extortion like what I saw with the ESG mafia and the thugs that try to push corporate America into doing things that satisfy a political agenda,” Morris said onBreitbart News Saturday.ESG was one of the major vectors by which Wall Street firms, namely asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, could push publicly listed companies to back leftist policies such as anti-climate change policies, diversity quotas, among others.Companies, facing a backlash, stopped employing these controversial policies.Morris then said he invested in Strive, a firm backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, that seeks to push anti-ESG policies, and challenge BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street.“We got to fight the ESG mafia that has been coming against our corporate leaders as an extension of politics to satisfy the leftist agenda,” he remarked.Morris said that the country needs to expose “ESG for the scam it is.”Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.Sean Moran is a policy reporter for Breitbart News.

AI Is Changing The Wealth Management Industry… Forever.,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/garydrenik/2025/02/25/ai-is-changing-the-wealth-management-industry-forever/,"LeadershipLeadership StrategyAI Is Changing The Wealth Management Industry… Forever.ByGary Drenik, Contributor.Gary Drenik is a writer covering AI, analytics and innovation.Follow AuthorFeb 25, 2025, 10:00am ESTSave ArticleCommentArtificial Intelligence for Wealth ManagementAdobeStock_411467966As demographics shift to a new generation of investors, wealth managers are facing significant challenges that are turning their investment world upside down. The primary driver for change is the emergence of alternative and private investments and the desire for investors to exert more control over their capital. Gone are the days where cursory performance only mattered and where similar investment strategies could apply to a broad class of investors.Today’s investors want choices, they want customization and alternative investment strategies. Investors and wealth management clients have different needs and risk tolerances where equity returns, and income generation need to be balanced.The wealth management industry is growing at a fast pace and catering to individual requirements is adding pressure. Wealth advisors are expected to keep pace with market shifts, geopolitical influences, and economic factors; and wealth managers run the risk of losing clients or not meeting their clients’ wealth expectations. Ultimately, they can fall into oblivion.To add fuel to the fire, technological advancements are opening new doors, while at the same time regulatory requirements are burdening wealth management teams. These dynamics are creating both challenges and opportunities for wealth managers striving to stay competitive and deliver more value to their clients. See below for key trends shaping the industry and opportunities for wealth managers as well as predictions for the future of investing.Key Challenges increasing AI demandClient expectations are evolving. For example, Millennials and Gen-Z investors want to take ESG factors into consideration and expect an engaging experience as they monitor their investments while Gen-X and older generations are seeking better income generation and perseveration of wealth. Traditional approaches to wealth are not satisfying the curated demands across clients.MORE FOR YOUCourt Lets Trump Fire Watchdog Chief For Now: Here’s Where Trump And Musk Are Winning—And Losing—In Court‘Hamilton’ Cancels Kennedy Center Show Run In Protest Of Trump’s ‘Purge’Fox News Sets Record As Trump’s Speech Draws 32 Million ViewersAccording to a recentProsper Insights & Analyticssurvey, more than 63% of respondents in the Gen-Z category expressed that ESG issues are important to very important, versus only 43% of their Gen-X counterpart. This shift in demographics is creating new requirements and new regulations that significantly increase the burden on wealth managers and investment advisors.Prosper - Importance Of ESG When Buying StocksProsper Insights & AnalyticsThese changes are driving a technological disruption. Autonomous AI agents are opening new doors and creating an edge for those who harness it; but they are also a looming threat for those who do not embrace transformational change.In a recentProsper Insights & Analyticssurvey, a staggering 44% in the Boomers generation do not trust AI to have their best interest in mind, compared to only 21% of Gen-Z’s age group. This means that the tolerance for AI is much higher with the younger generation and will accelerate the adoption of more automated services for investors.Prosper - Concerns About Recent Developments in AIProsper Insights & AnalyticsFurthermore, geopolitical tensions, inflation, and climate change contribute to market volatility, thereby increasing the need for real time investment insights. Purpose-built AI is a critical component in the ability to guide investors to make timely and informed decisions. The purpose-build AI can also allow wealth managers to keep pace with regulatory compliance requirements in an era where regulatory complexity is increasing rapidly in global markets. Mobility and client demand for new international investments can add to the multi-jurisdictional requirements as well as confusion on how to properly handle governance and reporting.Opportunities for Wealth Managers and High Net Worth InvestorsAn increasing number of high-net-worth individuals are creating demand for alternative investments including private equity, early-stage start-ups, cryptocurrency, and even more visibility to small-cap and micro-cap companies. These types of investment vehicles were previously reserved to a small group of elite investors as it was very difficult, costly or time consuming to access and managing the requirements across a diverse portfolio where due diligence skills are essential.One of the biggest challenges to private and alternative investments is access to first-hand insights to properly evaluate opportunities that guide and manage investment strategies or even trading decisions. This is not necessarily a data problem but an access to data issue as well as a skill gap in analyzing the wealth of data that could be available.“Data alone is useless. Insights are, valuable! And insights are only achieved when data is effectively blended and analyzed from many different sources.”said Kevin Collins, founder and CEO ofCharli AI Inc., a financial services company that uses Multidimensional AI™ to analyze private and public company information to provide investment guidance and perform deep analysis for their clients.Charli’s advanced technology was developed by a team of scientists in their AI Lab to be specifically trained and optimized on being a financial expert. The AI’s financial markets expertise enables the analysis of real-time capital market information and the immediate generation of insights that reduces the barrier to entry for the new generation of investor. This is a key feature in opening up the private markets to a broader set of investors.As indicated in a recent LP (Limited Partners) survey by McKinsey & Company, 30 percent of respondents said they plan to increase their private equity allocations in the next 12 months. This isn’t surprising given the fact that still according toMcKinsey & Company, the returns in private equity investment has outpaced the S&P 500 consistently since the turn of the millennium.Wealth managers have an opportunity to seize the first movers’ advantage to offer custom services and access to private equity investment without increasing the back-office cost. But this requires partnering with the right vendors that have been proven in delivering financial results. The noise in the AI space is getting harder and harder to navigate and few companies can meet the stringent requirements of the capital markets space.OutlookSell Side research will face fierce competition with incoming automated solutions that enable larger scale analysis and will see a decreasing demand for sell side analysts. VC analysts are also going to be heavily challenged by automated solutions for private company due diligence and valuation.Moreover, we will see a disruption in traditional investment platforms and financial data providers that can be heavily augmented or even displaced by automated solutions that are far more scalable and less dependent on finite structured data.Capital investment will be redistributed as individual investors gain more control over their investment strategies, which in turn may shake out the entire market. The private equity market will especially be affected and given that it represents more than 90% of small to mid-size companies worldwide according toS&P Capital IQ.ConclusionWealth management, and Capital Markets, are about to undergo a significant disruption. The investment landscape is evolving, and wealth managers have a rare opportunity to take more control over the sector as they become an important conduit for new demographics of investors. This could be a unique and moment in time where wealth managers have an advantage over large financial institutions.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades"

Vanguard Pauses Corporate Meetings Over New ESG Guidance,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Insurance Journal'}",https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2025/02/20/812551.htm,"Vanguard Pauses Corporate Meetings Over New ESG GuidanceByRoss Kerber|February 20, 2025Email ThisSubscribe to NewsletterArticle1 CommentTop mutual fund manager Vanguard has paused meetings with portfolio companies while it reviews the impact of new guidance on investor activism from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar with the matter.In a recent notice, the SEC, whose acting chair was appointed by President Donald Trump, revised its “beneficial ownership reporting” interpretations in ways that could put new burdens on firms like Vanguard that now rely on the SEC’s Schedule 13G form to report major holdings.Going forward, the SEC said managers may need to use the more complex Schedule 13D, which would increase their costs, if they pressure management on matters like climate questions or whether a company has a staggered board or poison pill takeover defenses.Vanguard put the pause in place because it is “trying to process and understand the new guidelines so they can remain a 13G filer and not a 13D filer,” said one of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.Ending the meetings could reduce the power of shareholder activists focused on environmental, social or governance questions, corporate attorneys say, the apparent goal of the SEC’s current leadership. But it could also diminish the input that executives receive from top investors on more traditional corporate questions like executive pay.A Vanguard representative did not respond to questions on Tuesday.Rival asset manager BlackRock had also paused meetings with some of its portfolio companies. A company representative did not immediately comment on the status of these meetings on Tuesday.Copyright 2025 Reuters.Click for restrictions.Was this article valuable?YesNoThank you!

EU Mounts Major Retreat From ESG Agenda Amid Fierce Backlash,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Insurance Journal'}",https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/02/25/813249.htm,"EU Mounts Major Retreat From ESG Agenda Amid Fierce BacklashByJohn AingerandFrances Schwartzkopff|February 25, 2025Email ThisSubscribe to NewsletterArticle0 CommentsThe European Union is about to walk back significant chunks of planned ESG regulations, amid a barrage of complaints that such rules are becoming a dead weight hampering EU efforts to compete with the US and Asia.The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, has proposed that regulations covering everything from ESG reporting requirements to supply-chain management be watered down to protect business interests in the bloc, according to documents seen by Bloomberg. The final proposal is set to be made public on Wednesday.The move follows intense pressure both from within and outside Europe to rein in environmental, social and governance legislation. The development has major implications for the future of ESG globally, with Europe accounting for well over 80% of the world’s ESG fund assets.Read more:EU Plans to Walk Back Key Planks of Toughest ESG LegislationGermany and France, the EU’s two largest economies, have been lobbying hard for smaller and mid-sized companies to be excluded from the full scope of reporting requirements, as both countries react to faltering economic productivity. In France, a government spokesperson went so far as to characterize ESG corporate reporting rules as “hell” for the companies expected to comply.Europe’s decision to scale back its ESG agenda comes as American companies enter a new age of deregulation under President Donald Trump. The 78-year-old has taken a sledgehammer to the green agenda of his predecessor, Joe Biden, and has made tariffs a cornerstone of US trade policy.The EU has also faced more direct pressure from the US to rein in the scope of its ESG regulations. Newly confirmed US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told Republican senators last month that he was willing to consider deploying “trade tools” to ensure American companies exposed to the EU market aren’t expected to comply with CSDDD.US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick; Photo credit: Al Drago/BloombergThe changes now being proposed by the commission represent “major rollbacks” of the original intention of Europe’s ESG agenda, said David Carlin, the former head of risk at the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative and the founder ofD.A. Carlin and Company.The commission is recommending that the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive be considerably reined in. That includes lower potential fines and a reduced obligation to monitor the ESG risks of business partners, suppliers and customers. What’s more, CSDDD’s original requirement that companies be exposed to legal liability if their value chains contain environmental or social violations is being dropped.The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which will put a levy on EU imports of goods like steel and cement from countries with less strict climate policies, will be softened so that domestic companies face a reduced reporting requirement.The commission is also proposing that only firms with over 1,000 employees and annual revenue exceeding €450 million ($470 million) be subject to the full scope of both the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and CSDDD. Doing so would exclude an estimated 85% of the companies originally targeted in CSRD, and would be in line with German and French demands.Meanwhile, a provision for so-called double materiality — a concept that requires companies to take into account not just the financial ESG risks they may face but also their environmental and social impact — looks to be intact, according to draft material seen by Bloomberg. Given the proposed cuts to CSDDD and CSRD, however, the provision would likely apply to fewer companies than originally intended.Read more:US Companies Say ESG Rules Are a Serious Barrier to EU TradeOther changes proposed by the commission include delaying CSRD reporting by a year and easing requirements around audits and climate transition plans.A spokesperson for the commission declined to comment, citing a policy of not responding to leaks.The proposal “will be a welcome development for CSRD reporters,” saidMichael Littenberg, global head ofRopes & Gray‘s ESG, CSR & Business and Human Rights compliance practice. However, more clarity is needed around the granularity of reporting requirements for the companies that remain in scope, he said.“Denmark, France and Germany, among others, have called for the reporting requirements to be scaled back,” Littenberg said. “The commission presumably will do so through separate delegated acts. However, to aid compliance planning by companies and reduce unnecessary work, they hopefully will preview the plan when the omnibus proposal is released.”Lawmakers from the EU’s green bloc, meanwhile, were quick to denounce the planned adjustments.“It is an illusion to think that dismantling sustainability laws will solve the structural problems of the economy,” saidAnna Cavazzini, a green lawmaker who’s chair of the internal market committee, in an emailed comment.She says Europe’s competitiveness problems are instead “due to the current China shock, to a lack of innovation, to high energy prices brought by the war of aggression against Ukraine, and to insufficient investment. They are certainly not due to the EU due diligence law, which is not even in force yet.”The European Sustainable Investment Forum, also known as Eurosif, added its voice to the list of critics.The adjustments to the regulations are “massive,” said Eurosif Executive DirectorAleksandra Palinska. The commission looks to be proposing “drastic changes to the scope of sustainability reporting rules,” to an extent that “will limit investor access to comparable and reliable sustainability data and impair their ability to scale-up investments for industrial decarbonization and long-term growth.”The commission is due to unveil its proposal for the so-called omnibus legislation on Feb. 26, when the bloc will look at CSDDD, CSRD and the Taxonomy Regulation.EU Financial Services Commissioner Maria Luis Albuquerque; photo credit: Simon Wohlfahrt/BloombergMaria Luis Albuquerque, the EU’s financial services commissioner, said in an interview last month that there’s room for adjustments to ESG rules, while noting that outright deregulation isn’t the goal.It’s about “adjusting the pace,” while “maintaining the anchor,” she said then.But civil society groups are now questioning that characterization.The planned rollback of ESG regulations looks “reckless,” saidMaria van der Heide, head of EU policy at nonprofit ShareAction. “Sustainability laws designed to tackle the most pressing crises – climate breakdown, human rights abuses, corporate exploitation – are being crossed out behind closed doors and at record speed. This is not simplification, it’s pure deregulation.”Photograph: Wind turbines and the Boxberg lignite coal-fired power plant, seen from Teichland, Germany, on Tuesday, Nov. 7, 2023.

Major Players Now See ESG As a Key Component of Hospitality Investment Decisions,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Hospitality Net'}",https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4125989.html,"Press ReleaseEnvironment & SustainabilityMajor Players Now See ESG As a Key Component of Hospitality Investment DecisionsEnergy & Environment Alliance Ltd25 February 2025The Energy & Environment Alliance (EEA) has released its latest report, ""How Important is ESG in Hospitality Investment Decisions?"" which is based on in-depth interviews with investors responsible for over $360 billion in hotel assets. The findings underscore the growing role Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations play in shaping the future of hotel and lodging investment strategies for all investment groups, as follows.Key Findings:Energy Efficiency Leads ESG Priorities -Energy efficiency remains a primary focus for investors, driven by rising energy costs, regulatory pressures, and evolving market expectations.Growing ESG Scrutiny in Transactions and Access to Finance -Investors and buyers are increasingly evaluating hotels' ESG credentials, but whilst the impact of these credentials is difficult to isolate on exit valuations, we are seeing a notable impact on liquidity and a clear demonstration of brown discounts or transition capex to meet ESG standards. Institutional investors and more recently larger Private Equity investors are leading the shift, prioritising assets which can meet their ESG criteria and can be placed on a clear path to decarbonise. New regulations like Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) compliance are influencing many owner-operator groups and creating accountability at senior management levels.ESG Engagement Varies -Most groups now have acquisition checklists but the way in which ESG is impacting investment decision making is variable. Institutional investors have already embedded ESG due diligence into underwriting processes, Private equity investors are following and whilst we are starting to see dispositions with ESG as a driver, we are at a nascent point in this regard. The engagement across owner-operator groups and HNWs varies but there are plenty of examples of excellence which have attracted the attention of large private equity players who are looking to back credible investment strategies with a strong attitude towards risk management, of which ESG is a key component. However, all investor categories recognize the growing importance of regulatory compliance and the link between energy efficiency and asset performance.Lenders Are Driving ESG Adoption -Sustainable finance is becoming increasingly important to the hospitality sector, with banks incorporating ESG considerations into financing terms. Right now, addressing ESG issues is more important to get access to finance rather than to get more attractive commercial terms. Green bonds and sustainability-linked loans are on the rise, though access to these instruments remains limited in certain regions.…As Are Corporate Buyers -ESG credentials are increasingly influencing corporate travel decisions and brand strategies, and although evidence of a consumer's willingness to pay a premium remains limited and difficult to isolate, there appears to be a correlation between higher demand and occupancy.Although the hospitality sector is at a nascent point compared to other sectors, ESG considerations are growing in importance and starting to shape asset management and pricing decisions amongst the large players. Recently, Private Equity has been able to sweep up the best assets at attractive yields, but with the return of institutional investors, we expect to see an increase in transactions and greater focus on ESG credentials. Owing to divergent approaches to ESG, I expect there to be a hunger for collaboration and knowledge sharing in the investment community, which is the aim of the EEA Capital Markets Committee.Rekha Toora, Chair of the EEA Capital Markets Committee and Senior Vice President, Jones Lang LaSalle, Hotels and HospitalityESG is central to underwriting processes, risk mitigation, and long-term value creation. ESG considerations are well embedded in all steps of the investment cycle.David Kellett, Managing Director and Head of Alternative Investments, Invesco Real EstateEnergy is now one of our top cost considerations, where it used to be much lower. This has made capex projects that weren’t previously viable suddenly interesting investments.Gilles Clavie, Chief Executive Officer, AccorInvest.We believe that accounting for sustainability considerations enables us to protect and create value at the asset level. These considerations are integrated across the asset lifecycle, from acquisition to disposal, reflecting both regulatory drivers and client expectations.Natalia Kolotneva, Head of Living and Hospitality for Europe, LaSalle Investment Management.The report concludes that ESG will continue to shape hospitality investment strategies, with regulatory compliance, capital market pressures, and customer expectations driving adoption. Institutional investors and financial institutions are expected to further refine ESG benchmarking and standardisation efforts, enhancing transparency and comparability across the sector.“This report makes it clear that ESG considerations are becoming increasingly important to everyone involved in owning, operating, investing in and financing hospitality assets. However, with divergent approaches, the need for standardisation is compelling - and that’s what the EEA is seeking to facilitate,” said Ufi Ibrahim, Chief Executive Officer, Energy & Environment Alliance.Environment & SustainabilityReal Estate & InvestmentEnergy & Environment Alliance LtdIndustry AssociationYour content on Hospitality Net?Hospitality Net membership explained"

EU Plans to Walk Back Key Planks of Toughest ESG Legislation,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Insurance Journal'}",https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/02/24/812952.htm,"EU Plans to Walk Back Key Planks of Toughest ESG LegislationByFrances SchwartzkopffandJohn Ainger|February 24, 2025Email ThisSubscribe to NewsletterArticle2 CommentsThe European Commission is proposing a significant watering down of what was arguably its most consequential piece of ESG regulation.The European Union’s executive arm is proposing that the bloc amend eight main points in the scope of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, according to a draft proposal seen by Bloomberg. The changes span everything from limiting corporate obligations to monitor potential ESG breaches in supply chains, to reducing potential fines.The move follows intense pressure on the bloc — both from within and outside Europe — to rein in a piece of legislation whose early design was intended to expose companies to legal liability if they failed to purge their value chains of ESG violations. Companies in the EU have warned that complying with CSDDD will make it harder to compete with the US and Asia. In France, officials have gone so far as to ask that CSDDD be shelved.EU Weighs Easing Corporate Liability Under Toughest ESG LawIn the US, meanwhile, incoming US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told Republican senators last month that he was willing to consider deploying “trade tools” to ensure American companies exposed to the EU market aren’t expected to comply with CSDDD.The commission is due to unveil its proposal for the so-called omnibus legislation on Feb. 26. Aside from CSDDD, the omnibus process will also look at ways to simplify the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the Taxonomy Regulation.A spokesperson for the commission declined to comment, citing a policy of not responding to leaks.The proposed amendments to CSDDD seek to:Extend the scope of “maximum harmonization” to ensure CSDDD aligns well with other regulationsBroadly limit the concept of due diligence so that it only applies to direct business partnersRemove the obligation to end business ties as a “measure of last resort”Limit the notion of “stakeholder” and further restrict the stages of the due diligence process that require stakeholder engagementExtend the intervals in which companies need to monitor the adequacy and effectiveness of their due diligence measuresClarify the principles around monetary penalties, and remove the minimum cap for finesRemove aspects of the civil liability clause and the rules regarding representative actionsDelete the review clause regarding the extent to which financial services firms might be in scope in futureThe proposal is already drawing criticism from civil society groups that had been lobbying for the EU to stick to the original principles of CSDDD.The planned rollback looks “reckless,” saidMaria van der Heide, head of EU policy at nonprofit ShareAction. “Sustainability laws designed to tackle the most pressing crises – climate breakdown, human rights abuses, corporate exploitation – are being crossed out behind closed doors and at record speed. This is not simplification, it’s pure deregulation.”(Bloomberg) —Maria Luis Albuquerque, the EU’s financial services commissioner, said in an interview last month that there’s room for adjustments to ESG rules, but cautioned against expecting outright deregulation.It’s about “adjusting the pace,” while “maintaining the anchor,” she said then.Photograph: Solar panels at the Weesow-Willmersdorf solar park, operated by EnBW Energie Baden-Wrttemberg AG, in Werneuchen, Germany, on Tuesday, Aug. 2, 2022.

[+]Forum of the Americas (IEFA) on Sept. 4, 2019. Photographer: Cole Burston/Bloomberg© 2019 Bloomberg Finance LPMade In Canada: A Playbook For Business Leaders In AmericaIn an era marked by radical political, economic, and social uncertainty, business leaders in Canada have redefined what it means to be successful.With threats oftariffson Canadian goods looming—and provocative remarks like Trump’s offhand idea of Canada becoming the “51st state”—the North American business landscape is under renewed scrutiny. Yet here in Canada, a robust, homegrown movement to buy “Made in Canada” has taken root, driven by national pride and a belief that economic strength and community well-being can—and must—go hand in hand.This cultural awakening is more than a trend. It’s a signal that Canadians are embracing a new era of proactive engagement in local industry and social progress. The recent triumph in the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off not only reaffirmed the country’s unique competitive spirit, but also underscored the notion that, for Canadians, winning isn’t a zero-sum game — it’s an opportunity for shared success.I spoke with three of Canada’s most iconic business leaders—Patchell-Evans from GoodLife Fitness; Jenn Harper, Founder & CEO of Cheekbone Beauty; and Guy Cormier, President of Desjardins Group—to find out what “Made in Canada” leadership looks like and share ideas that can benefit American business leaders in today’s volatile political climate.Patchell-Evans founded GoodLife Fitness in 1979. Since then, it has become the largest health club company in Canada. “Canadians used to buy American products because they were from somewhere else and they were cool,” said David Patchell-Evans, CEO of GoodLife Fitness. “American is no longer cool in Canada.”MORE FOR YOUCourt Lets Trump Fire Watchdog Chief For Now: Here’s Where Trump And Musk Are Winning—And Losing—In Court‘Hamilton’ Cancels Kennedy Center Show Run In Protest Of Trump’s ‘Purge’Apple Takes No Risks With New M4 MacBook AirCheekbone Beauty, the company founded by Harper in 2015, has created a space in the beauty industry where everyone, including Indigenous people, feel represented and seen. ""Representation saves lives,” says Harper. “This is the core of Cheekbone Beauty.""Desjardins Group is a 125 year old Canadian financial service cooperative that is the largest federation of credit unions in North America, “At Desjardins we’re contributing to society, not only with the taxes that we’re paying, but throughout our business, with our suppliers, at our call center, and with the profits we’ve made every year we’ve been in business,” said Cormier.Patchell-Evans, Harper and Cormier offered lessons in “Made in Canada” leadership that extend beyond the border. What they shared is rooted in human rights, long-term vision, community partnerships, and and being profitable in a way that helps everyone win. The Canadian playbook provides a compelling case for American business leaders that demonstrates why doing well and doing good are indivisible.Businesses in Canada Stand Up For Human RightsAt a time when many businesses in the U.S. arerolling backorcuttingDEI programs, businesses in Canada believe treating people fairly and equitably is not up for debate. “I have businesses in the States and I’m not going to operate them differently now,” said Patchell-Evans. “It doesn't matter who gets elected, we're going to be fair to our members and fair to our staff.”“Before ESG or DEI existed, Desjardins was already prioritizing what we do based on our mission to help our members and clients to become financially autonomous,” said Cormier. “And operating in ways that reflect our values which include engagement, solidarity, democracy, and helping to put money to work for people.”“Canadian businesses emphasize creating opportunities for underrepresented groups, whether through employment, partnerships, or programs that address systemic inequities,” said Harper. “Canadian businesses often stand out for their community-first approach, driven by values of equity, inclusion, and sustainability.”Made in Canada business is grounded in treating diverse employees and other stakeholders equitably. By standing up for human rights, Canadian companies are building more inclusive organizations and setting a global standard for what ethical leadership can achieve.CEO and president of Good Life David Patchell-Evans practices on his rowing machine. (Photo by Jim... [+]Ross/Toronto Star via Getty Images)Toronto Star via Getty ImagesBusiness Leaders In Canada Play The Long GameCanadian leaders also emphasized the importance of forward-thinking strategies over quarterly gains. Cormier believes it’s important to “bring a more long-term perspective to business performance instead of just the next quarter by investing in our people, investing in our systems, and investing in our products.”“The New York style of doing a deal is ‘OK, let's agree that we're gonna do a deal.And then once we've signed it, then we start negotiating,’” said Patchell-Evans. “Having a short term attitude doesn't lead to long term success.”“I’m particularly proud of our commitment to education — we donate a portion of our profits to organizations supporting Indigenous education through the Cheekbone Scholarship Fund,” said Harper. “This is not just charity but a long-term investment in our next generations.”In today’s environment, short-term political pressures, market volatility and pressure from activist investors can compromise a company’s mission and values. Made in Canada businesses focus on strategic investments that deliver value over decades not quarters or electoral terms.Companies In Canada Believe In CommunitiesBeyond profit margins and market share, Canadian businesses have woven community well-being into the fabric of their operations.“Cheekbone Beauty was built on the foundation of giving back to Indigenous youth and addressing the systemic barriers that many face,” said Harper. ""Our mission is not just about creating high-quality, sustainable beauty products but also ensuring that our success translates into tangible benefits for the community. This goes beyond the transactional — it’s about creating a shared sense of purpose and uplifting communities while maintaining financial success.”“There’s a uniquely Canadian humility in how we prioritize collaboration over competition, and this ethos reflects in how many of our companies are deeply intertwined with their communities,” said Cormier. “At Desjardins we’re contributing to society, not only with the taxes that we’re paying, but throughout our business, with our suppliers, at our call center, and with the profits we’ve made every year we’ve been in business,” said Cormier.This deep-seated community orientation is a testament to how Canadian businesses prize collaboration over competition and view long-term profitability as inseparable from community impact.Jennifer Harper, CEO of Cheekbone Beauty  on International Women's Day at the Porcupine Dante Club.... [+]NICOLE STOFFMAN/The Daily Press jpg, TDNICOLE STOFFMAN/The Daily PressIn Canada Everybody WinsAt the heart of Canada’s business culture lies a commitment to making a profit in a way that is also fair to business partners and consumers.“I think there's a focus on win-win that's just a part of our culture,’ said Patchell-Evans. “It's not just me winning with you. It's us winning together and everybody else winning too.”“Every year we are returning half a billion dollars to communities, member dividends, sponsorships, and donations and still making two or three billion dollars per year of net profit with returns of 10 or 12%,” said Cormier. ”Even though we see more and more people that are banking with us online, we still have more than 500 branches in smaller regions because we want to stay in proximity to our members and their communities. We also decided that our call center will stay in Canada and not be outsourced to somewhere else in the world. Why? Because we want to contribute to the economy here locally.""The “Made in Canada” business philosophy is about more than heavy-handed negotiation tactics—it reflects a broader belief that success is most sustainable when it is shared.Business leaders in Canada are proving that profitability and social impact are not mutually exclusive. The “Made in Canada” playbook, with its unwavering commitment to human rights, belief in long-term investments, partnerships with communities, and emphasis on win–win, instead of win-lose, offers a compelling model for executives on both sides of the border.Business leaders in America should also know that their Canadian counterparts view the current political challenge with the United States as an opportunity. “I’m convinced that even though there is uncertainty and risk right now, there is also opportunity,” said Cormier. “And as CEOs and leaders, we are paid to also find these opportunities - and some of them are in the area of ESG or investing in clean energy.”“There is a massive opportunity for businesses in Canada to be really healthy in this country and want to stay here and grow,” said Patchell-Evans. “The call to action is for businesses to invest in Canada and consumers to invest in Canada.”In today’s world of radical uncertainty, this uniquely Canadian approach is a blueprint for building a better, more inclusive future.Did you enjoy this story?

[+]health and climate change.Courtesy of E1As politics continue to stifle climate action, experts like marine ecologist Carlos Duarte are turning to sports to sound the alarm that climate change requires immediate action. E1, the first fully electric motorboat racing championship, is answering the call by providing sports entertainment in iconic marine environments while driving technological solutions that can help repair ocean health and decarbonize aquatic mobility.It’s a pivotal moment for E1. In its second season, the electric motorboat racing championship is expanding from 5 race locations to 7, has secured broadcast deals with DAZN and CBS Sports, and has added new team owners like NBA superstarLeBron James.With two new race locations on two different continents set to be announced after the Doha GP, E1 is pushing to become a globally recognized racing championship all while the waters its athletes race on continue to warm.Duarte is collaborating with E1 because he feels that sports “push the limits of the possible,” and humans “need that spirit” to restore ocean health.Sports’ RoleDuarte — who on top of his role as Tarek Ahmed Juffali Research Chair in Red Sea Ecology at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, is the Chief Scientist for E1, Oceans 2050, and Ocean US — spoke to me ahead of the E1 Doha GP to explain his collaboration with the championship. The ecologist said, “I discovered that sports are the biggest unifier in this polarized world.”Duarte referenced that roughly 75% of humans watch the FIFA World Cup and that sports create joy and mimicry that few other aspects of life provoke. Team owner LeBron James has over 200 million social media followers, and collectively E1 owners — which includeTom Brady, Rafa Nadal, Virat Kohli, Didier Drogba, Will Smith, and Marc Anthony — have over 1 billion followers. This, according to Duarte, means they, and now E1, have the “power to mobilize people in the right direction,” because fans tend to listen when their sports heroes take a stance on an issue.MORE FOR YOUCrypto Braced For Another Trump Earthquake After Bitcoin, XRP, Solana And Cardano Price BoomOscars 2025 Full Winners List (Live Updates)Oscar Winners: ‘Anora’ Wins Best Picture While Adrien Brody And Mikey Madison Take Home Top Acting HonorsSporting icons taking a stance on climate is pivotal in a moment when sports are being commandeered for political and commercial means. E1 is part of the Saudi Private Investment Fund-backed Electric 360 partnership that focuses on advancing electric mobility. PIF has a growing sports portfolio that includes LIV Golf, Formula 1, and the 2034 FIFA World Cup.PIF is also funded in large part by decades of Saudi oil and gas sales. When confronted about this, E1 Co-founder and CEO Rodi Basso sought to assuage concerns, stating, “Since I came across PIF, I’ve seen them collaborating with us, believing in us, contacting local authorities to help them, and encouraging people to install new electric technologies.”Sports can also be a fertile testing ground for new technologies. Motorsports have a long history of bringing race technologies to the road. Duarte and Basso would like to do the same with aquatic mobility technologies and infrastructure, which Duarte says are roughly 15 years behind the automotive industry. Simply put, while EVs are common nowadays, electric boats are not.E1’s SolutionsRodi Basso founded E1 to help find technical solutions to aquatic mobility and to raise awareness about declining marine ecosystems. He is using E1 to ensure future generations can continue living in coastal areas and enjoying exciting sports events like they currently do. He says, “Honestly, I feel the responsibility to keep providing entertainment in a responsible way.”E1’s three foundational pillars are innovation, marine lifestyle, and ESG. By expanding the race calendar, E1’s executives hope to address all three: providing exciting and sustainable events in new locations around the world while allowing universities and private companies to study and trial new technologies that can be applied outside the race circuit to other sectors.For Basso, “ESG is a way to create value, not a stealth PR strategy.” During season 2, E1 is working alongside space agencies — Basso is an aerospace engineer by trade — to see if the ecosystem changes its scientists see in coastal waters are mirrored by what space agency satellites are picking up.While its teams compete on the water, E1 is also undergoingISO 20121certification, which provides guidelines and best practices for sustainable event management. This is so E1 can host net-zero sporting events. The championship already has PAS 2060, an internationally recognized standard that demonstrates carbon neutrality. However, Basso is adamant that the ultimate goal is zero-emission events, which he is sure the championship will achieve.According to Basso, E1’s average emissions per race are 335 tons of CO2 equivalent. Per the EPA’sGreenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator, that’s the same as 40 homes’ energy use for one year. The number is relatively high, but still 200 tons lower thanFormula 1.To lower the environmental impact, E1 is implementing more technology to track its carbon footprint and it is looking for ways to reduce the freight it needs to ship from race to race. It is also fully rolling out itsBlue Impact Championship, which mimicsSailGP’sImpact League. The Blue Championship “challenges teams to drive positive impact by mobilizing society to reverse effects on ocean and aquatic systems.”In Basso’s words, the Championship is hugely important for E1 because it “moves the focus from being the best in the world to doing the best for the world.” The program focuses on the transfer of knowledge and is fully supported by each of the celebrity team owners. Critically, each action is verified and judged by an expert panel (including Duarte). One sample action is donating money to support aquatic research and restoration programs.Defending Champion Team Brady's E1 Race Bird flies over the water at the Jeddah GP. Jeddah was the... [+]opening race of E1's second season.Courtesy of E1 (Photo by Birgit Dieryck)According to Duarte, “The launch of the E1 Blue Impact Championship provides a blueprint and pathway for each of our participating teams to become active partners in our mission, and for them to be acknowledged for their innovations and inventiveness in supporting appropriate initiatives. It’s an exciting challenge for both us and the teams and provides a new and progressive arena in which to compete.”On the water, E1’s “RaceBird” boats are fully electric and use a foil design which creates spray but not waves. The spray effect helps reduce waves and in turn coastal erosion, a characteristic many coastal cities, like Venice, suffer from.The use of electric engines is not only more efficient, it reduces noise pollution by close to 80% compared to internal combustion engines. Noise pollution is a mere annoyance for humans, but it can be detrimental to marine life that uses echolocation to communicate. Professor Duarte and his team used last season’s Lake Como GP as a testing ground for E1’s noise pollution. On nearby Lake Maggiore, he and his team got results showing that the noise pollution from electric boats was 50 times quieter above water. It was so quiet that the team could still hear the birds in the nearby forest chirping. Underwater, they found that the frequency of sound was much higher, which meant it dissipated quicker in the water and created less animal interference.For Duarte, part of the allure of working with E1 is helping aquatic mobility catch up with others. He notes that of all the marinas E1 raced in during its first season, Lake Como was the only one with other electric boats or charging stations.If E1 races can provide the impetus needed to create more electric infrastructure, then it will have provided a net positive aside from entertainment. Duarte draws parallels between the space industry and the sports sector, as they have similar budgets. Space has always been an innovative industry, whereas sports (motorsports aside) have done little to provide new sustainable technologies, something Duarte would like to see change. He says there is “huge scope to improve this and promote new technologies.”The Urgent Climate SituationAs someone who has traveled to the poles to research melting ice caps, Duarte feels the urgency more than most. He says he is often reminded of the Martin Luther King Jr. quote “We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today.” King was speaking about civil rights, but Duarte feels King’s idea of “fierce urgency of now” has taken on a new meaning in the face of climate change.As things stand, Duarte is most concerned about increasing ocean temperatures, the collapse of AMOC, rising sea levels, and changes in ocean chemistry. He notes that the world entered 1.5℃ of post-industrial warming in 2023. Such warmth is destroying entire ecosystems, eroding shorelines, increasing the intensity and density of hurricanes, and reducing the number of calcified organisms (mollusks) that are integral to marine health.Such devastation has a direct effect on humans. Roughly40%of the world’s population lives within 100km (60 miles) of the coast. In the US, 129 million people live in coastal communities, and22%are considered vulnerable populations.Duarte is not optimistic about the situation, but he is hopeful. He notes that the scientific and semantic distinction between the two is that hope implies that one is aiming for a positive outcome, but recognizes the challenges and hard work required to overcome them.He joined E1 because he realized that publishing more scientific papers wouldn’t galvanize people to take action. What he loves about E1 is that, unlike much environmental news, it is not about guilt, it’s about doing something fun, and fun motivates people.Over his 43 years of research, Duarte has learned how humans impact waterways, he has searched for solutions to ocean health issues, and now he is focused on delivering action. He is certain that his third act is his most important and knows that solutions exist.He notes that oceans became far cleaner due to indirect benefits from the Clean Air Act of 1970, and whale populations recovered after the global ban on whale hunting was imposed. He admits that coral reefs will be the hardest to save, as “we don’t currently have the technology to save corals for generations to come,” but he says “If we can recover a great whale, what is it we cannot do?”The world’s premier marine ecologist is convinced sports have a big part to play, noting, “Investing in healthy oceans is a good business proposition and so is E1, it’s an open market.”Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"

Closing The Gap: Confidence Is Key In Driving Women To Invest,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesfinancecouncil/2025/02/24/closing-the-gap-confidence-is-key-in-driving-women-to-invest/,"MoneyClosing The Gap: Confidence Is Key In Driving Women To InvestByOdiri Oginni, Forbes Councils Member.forForbes Finance CouncilCOUNCIL POSTExpertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author.| Membership (fee-based)Feb 24, 2025, 07:30am ESTSave ArticleDr. Odiri Oginni is Managing Director and CEO forUnited Capital Asset Management Limited.gettyWomen are playinga greater role in investment decisionsregarding retirement savings and stock market participation than ever before. However, despite this growing participation in investing, many women still report lower confidence in their investment decisions compared to men. The lower confidence levels that women struggle with in investing can be attributed to a number of factors including limited investment experience, social influences, lack of financial knowledge and cultural nuances.A study by Bank of America revealed that whilemore than 85% of womenare confident in managing their everyday financial tasks such as paying bills and managing a budget, only 53% are confident in managing investments and 44% in creating a diversified portfolio.Confidence is a key enabler to help drive women to invest, and lower confidence can impact long-term financial security, particularly in retirement. This makes it essential to understand the factors that influence women's investment confidence as well as how to close the gap.1. Investment Experience And Financial KnowledgeWhile financial knowledge is crucial for women, research has shown thatthis is not sufficientfor building women’s confidence in investing. This is because women are also less confident in their knowledge. Confidence is built through hands-on experience such as actively managing investments, engaging in financial discussions and making independent financial decisions.Women need consistent exposure to investment activities. Financial advisors can help bridge this gap by creating spaces where women can learn, ask questions and make informed choices without fear of judgment. Personalized financial education, coupled with real-world investing experience, can significantly enhance confidence levels.2. The Power Of Social Influence And Role ModelsWomen are more likely to invest when they see other women doing the same. Peer networks, women-focused investment communities and mentorship play a crucial role in shaping confidence.A study on the impact of social interaction on women’s financial decisions found that frequent visits to family or friendsincrease a woman’s likelihood of investingin stocks by 1.1%. This probability rises to 11% when the investment opportunity is a savings account. Additionally, women who engage in sports or regularly visit a health club are 7.9% and 6.6% more likely, respectively, to invest in financial opportunities.This suggests that social reinforcement plays a key role in women’s financial decisions and can be a driver of confidence in investing. Financial institutions and advisors can create spaces where women can interact with others including family, friends, colleagues and significant others who can provide emotional support. As women interact socially, they learn about historical records and successful strategies, which can boost their confidence in investing.3. Perception Of Risk And Investment BehaviorOne common research finding relating towomen’s investment behavioris that women are risk-averse. In reality, this risk-averse tendency can be a result of a more conscious approach to risk-taking where women take a calculated, long-term approach to investing rather than a speculative, short-term approach.Women’s investment confidence can grow when they understand risk management strategies, such as diversification and asset allocation. Financial education that reframes risk as an essential component of wealth-building, rather than a potential loss, can help women invest more boldly and with greater confidence.4. Financial Systems Must Adapt To Women’s NeedsMany traditional investment platforms and financial services have been designed with male investors in mind. Women, however, often approach investing with different priorities, such as long-term financial security, impact investing and aligning investments with personal values.Financial institutions and advisors that tailor investment products to these priorities—offering goal-based investing, ESG investment options and intuitive platforms—can make investing more accessible and appealing to women.5. Behavioral Strategies To Boost Investment ConfidenceBehavioral finance research suggests that small, incremental investment steps can help build confidence over time. For example, platforms that allow women to start with smaller investments, track progress toward financial goals and receive positive reinforcement can encourage long-term investing habits.Additionally, reframing investment success in terms of progress rather than immediate returns can shift mindsets and reduce hesitation. Encouraging women to adopt a long-term perspective and celebrating financial milestones can help sustain their confidence in investing.Closing The Confidence Gap In InvestingThe key to increasing women’s confidence in investing lies in experience, social reinforcement, risk education and financial systems that recognize their unique needs. Financial institutions and advisors have an opportunity to reshape the narrative by providing the right tools, networks and education to empower women as confident investors.For women looking to build investment confidence, the best approach is to start small, seek supportive financial communities and embrace investing as an ongoing journey rather than a single decision. The more you engage, the stronger your confidence will become, which will ultimately lead to greater financial independence and long-term wealth creation.Forbes Finance Councilis an invitation-only organization for executives in successful accounting, financial planning and wealth management firms.Do I qualify?Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"

MCI's Green Push: Rethinking Event Sourcing,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Skift'}",http://meetings.skift.com/2025/02/21/mcis-green-push-rethinking-event-sourcing/,"SustainabilityMCI's Green Push: Rethinking Event SourcingMiguel NevesFebruary 21st, 2025 at 2:00 AM ESTSkift TakeMCI's sustainability push could disrupt site sourcing. Its bespoke, standardized metrics call for transparency, and may set the tone for industry-wide change.ShareLinkedIn iconTwitter iconfacebook iconMail iconGlobal events agency MCI is implementing a new environmental, social, and governance (ESG) framework across its procurement operations, signaling a shift in how it approaches sustainability.The company aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030 for its operations and has set a target for its entire value chain to reach net-zero by 2050. These are tough targets for a company that is growing steadily.“What I call the basic sustainability — you know, the paperless, the no plastic, the local seasonal food, the more vegetarian, all the things that, for me, are starting to be the basic things that we should implement in the event — we cannot charge for that,” said Erica Fawer, MCI’s internal communication director and sustainability integration director. “It’s part of our culture of care and responsibilities, our USP [unique selling point],” she added.Fawer was speaking alongside Quentin Remy, MCI’s head of global procurement & strategic sourcing, at the recent MCI CheckedIn event. The event brought together the company’s procurement specialists from around the world with senior sales representatives of major hotel chains. A core objective was to get buy-in from hotel partners. Remy said MCI’s desire is to “involve all of our value chain on a global and on a local level. We want to use the strength of MCI. We have those partners and we believe that we need to use them to solve our ESG problems.”The Need for Standardized Sustainability MetricsThe framework emerged from MCI’s role as the official housing agency for the UN Climate Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in 2021. The company developed a supply chain assessment system, evaluating nearly 200 hotels representing 8,000 rooms across Glasgow and surrounding regions.“We managed to make a score out of it. The UN was very happy because it was kind of a new thing to actually involve sustainability rating into the decision-making of the group and the individuals that were coming to the conference,” said Remy. “It’s no longer just rates or where the hotel is. You also have the sustainability rating.”The same assessment system, based on 29 standardized questions, has now been integrated into MCI’s customized version of Cvent, allowing for consistent sustainability scoring across properties.“We need an apple-to-apple thing so that we can compare the same thing. It needs to become an SOP. It needs to be a fast and easy process,” said Remy. Each property now has an ESG assessment score in the system, allowing MCI’s planners to factor sustainability metrics into their venue selection process alongside traditional criteria like location and price. This also allows for conference attendees to make an informed decision on their hotel booking options.Navigating Implementation ChallengesWhile MCI’s sustainability framework is gaining traction internally, implementation requires building on the partnerships with major hotel chains that provide 70% of their total room inventory comprising 40,000 properties globally. Some chains have shown resistance to adopting more stringent sustainability practices or revealing data that may have their properties score lower than competitors.The company’s approach focuses on working with willing partners while maintaining pressure for industry-wide improvements.Integrating Sustainability into Business PracticesDespite progress, there is often talk of sustainability, but little action.To support the new framework, MCI is using two tools for carbon footprint measurement:myclimate Carbon Trackerfor basic measurement and offsetting capabilities, andTRACE by islawhich offers a more detailed analysis for recurring events. MCI has made it clear that it sees a business opportunity in building sustainability strategies for clients, not in basic measurement.The company’s voluntary adherence to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards in its most recent financial and sustainability report helps build trust with public companies that must meet similar standards in their own sustainability reporting.Its annual report showed that revenue increased 6% in 2023 to $515 million (€493.1 million) in 2023 and EBITDA from operations rose 29% to $31.9 million (€30.5 million). The report also detailed the company’s sustainability initiatives and discloses information about its ownership structure: The Tondeur family owns 37% of shares, senior management holds 43%, andprivate equity investorshold the remaining shares.The new framework comes as the European Union rolls out environmental regulations that will affect the events industry. Beyond the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), companies must navigate the Nature Restoration Law, Green Claims Directive, and Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation.“For a long time sustainability was like, it’s nice to have, it’s great, it’s a feel good. But there are some key deadlines if we want things to move forward and change,” Fawer said. “Now there are laws to force us to do that. It’s the same process as we did for our data protection, GDPR.”Looking AheadThe success of MCI’s framework, particularly its Cvent-integrated sustainability scoring system, could set new standards for the events industry. However, questions remain about widespread adoption and implementation costs. As new EU regulations come into force, other event agencies will need to step up, but the sheer magnitude of the task is daunting.“It’s an opportunity also for our clients, maybe generate more revenue, attracting different attendees because of whatever we implement around sustainability that is aligned with the company values or the association values,” Fawer said.As regulatory requirements increase and clients face their own sustainability pressures, MCI’s early moves in standardizing sustainability metrics could prove advantageous. The company’s ability to leverage its COP26 experience into a practical, scalable system, while navigating complex relationships with hotel partners and addressing evolving EU regulations, may provide a blueprint for the industry’s sustainable future.Transform your events with the power of AI.March 12- ONLINERegister NowShareLinkedIn iconTwitter iconfacebook iconMail iconMiguel NevesFebruary 21st, 2025 at 2:00 AM ESTTags:MCI,net zero,procurement,sourcing,sustainabilityPhoto Credit: Midjourney / Prompt: sustainable city hotel low carbon footprintUp NextLogistics & Operations10 Tips for Today’s Meeting Dress CodesWhile fitted suits were de rigueur in Mad Men, the only jackets you’ll see at most meetings today are of the outdoors variety.

Trump’s SEC Leader Shifts Power From Investors to Boardrooms,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Insurance Journal'}",https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2025/02/19/812475.htm,"Trump’s SEC Leader Shifts Power From Investors to BoardroomsByRoss Kerber|February 19, 2025Email ThisSubscribe to NewsletterArticle0 CommentsNew policies from the top U.S. securities regulator hand corporate boards more power over investors in ways that could curtail investor-initiated reform efforts on everything from climate policy to director contests, experts say.Since last month when U.S. President Donald Trump named Mark Uyeda acting chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency has made it easier for boards to block shareholder resolutions, put stricter filing requirements on passive funds, and limit investors’ communication abilities.The changes give directors more scope to nix efforts to have companies limit emissions or report workforce diversity details, while traditional activists running their own director slates could also find it harder to challenge boards, attorneys say.“It’s a relatively dramatic reallocation of power away from large shareholders back to corporate management, not just to make corporate policy but to protect themselves against activists,” said Tulane University business law professor Ann Lipton.Uyeda and other Republican officials – including Paul Atkins, Trump’s pick to run the SEC – have made clear their skepticism of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment considerations. “Shareholder meetings were not intended under state corporate laws to be political battlegrounds or debating societies,” Uyeda said ina 2023 speech.An SEC spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Atkins did not respond to questions sent via his current firm.FEWER BALLOT ITEMSThe SEC’s changes are in line with other Trump administration efforts such as dismantling diversity programs and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement.ESG resolutions drew significant support in 2021 and 2022, but less so since. In a February11 legal bulletin the SEC made it easier for companies to skip votes on the resolutions such as by claiming the proposals “micromanage” their businesses.That change could make it harder for ESG-minded activists even to start talks with corporate executives.“If it’s harder to get your resolution through at the SEC, it will be harder to do that kind of work,” said Rick Alexander, CEO of the Shareholder Commons, which tracks and writes resolutions.On Feb. 11, the SEC also revised “beneficial ownership reporting” interpretations to broaden the requirements on firms like asset managers BlackRock and Vanguard, which often rely on the SEC’s Schedule 13G form to report major holdings.Going forward, the agency tightened when managers can use the form rather than the more complex Schedule 13D, which would increase their costs. A new SEC test is if a company “exerts pressure on management” such as tying director votes to whether a company has a staggered board or poison pill takeover defenses.Proxy voting policies of both BlackRock and Vanguard suggest those circumstances could lead to critical votes.BlackRock and Vanguard declined to comment. BlackRock temporarily paused meetings with some portfolio companies as of Tuesday with an eye on the new rules.Jessica Strine, CEO of shareholder advisory firm Jasper Street Partners, said the SEC’s new interpretation could have a potential downside for companies as well if they cannot know what their top investors think.“It’s not a complete gift to management teams if it means they no longer have engagement opportunities with their top shareholders,” she said. “That means they don’t get to make their case” before votes are cast at annual meetings on matters like executive compensation.Caroline Crenshaw, currently the lone Democratic member of the SEC via e-mail said the change could chill the big funds’ outreach.“The interpretation muddies the waters for institutional investors, with the unstated goal of dissuading them from engaging with corporations. At bottom, this policy is bad for capital formation,” Crenshaw said.COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWNA third change involves new guidance on when investors can use the SEC’s electronic records system to distribute so-called “exempt solicitations,” or communications with other shareholders.Once meant as a tool to reveal closed-door discussions among bigger institutional holders, smaller investors started filing their own exempt solicitations as a cheap way to make their arguments on issues like whether to oppose a certain director or support a shareholder resolution.In a January 27 update the SEC narrowed their permissible use. The documents are “not intended to be the means through which a person disseminates written soliciting material to security holders,” the SEC said, but rather only to notify the public of written materials sent to security holders through other means.For Tom Quaadman, Senior Vice President for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a top business lobbying group, the SEC’s changes were welcome.“You’re seeing a rebalancing of SEC policies and rules that are designed to take out special interest activism and bring things back to a focus on investor return,” he said.Copyright 2025 Reuters.Click for restrictions.TopicsLeadershipWas this article valuable?YesNoThank you!

RIP to Government Acronyms,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Reason'}",https://reason.com/2025/02/23/rip-to-government-acronyms/,"Federal governmentRIP to Government AcronymsOne perk that may materialize from Elon Musk upending the federal bureaucracy is the downfall of the government’s obsessive use of abbreviations.Jay Stooksberry|2.23.2025 6:00 AMShare on FacebookShare on XShare on RedditShare by emailPrint friendly versionCopy page URLMedia Contact & Reprint Requests(Illustration: Lex Villena; Chiyacat | Dreamstime.com)From the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Elon Musk is on the warpath to devour the alphabet soup of the federal bureaucracy. ""We do need to delete entire agencies, as opposed to leave part of them behind,""saidthe world's richest man and President Donald Trump's consigliere.One perk that may materialize from his disruptive (andlegally dubious) actions is the downfall of one obnoxious governmental institution: abbreviations.""Acronyms seriously suck,"" read the subject line of anemailMusk sent to his entire SpaceX team. In his email, he explained how the ""excessive use of made up acronyms is a significant impediment to communication.""Musk is no stranger to arbitrary abbreviations. He created the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an obvious tip of the hat to hisfavorite pump-and-dump cryptocurrencynamed after the beloved, wide-eyed Shiba Inu. Musk has also attained the designation of aspecial government employee(SGE) to wreak havoc on the federal landscape.DOGE and SGE are just droplets in the seemingly endless stream of government abbreviations. Milton Friedman famously joked, ""Pick at random any three letters from the alphabet, put them in any order, and you will have an acronym designating a federal agency we can do without.""Like many, Friedman conflates acronyms and abbreviations. Acronyms are pronounced like words (e.g., NATO, FEMA, NASA), and initialisms are the composite of their individual letters (e.g., FBI, CIA, EPA).Grammatical pedantry aside, Musk and Friedman aren't wrong about the government's incessant use of abbreviations.The Age of the AcronymThere is no shortage of abbreviations in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Government Manuallistshundreds of cabinet-level departments, independent agencies, regulatory commissions, and government corporations and their accompanying abbreviations.And like a Russian nesting doll, each entity houses its own endless array of abbreviated jargon. The Department of Defense leads the way with over 4,000 abbreviations in itsinternal dictionary.Driving this Matryoshka-esque multiverse of abbreviations is lawmakers' love of acronyms. Legislators often reverse-engineer acronyms (or ""backronyms"") to create memorable mnemonic devices to market their legislation. Assuredly, bill nicknames like ""STOP SMUT"" roll off the tongue better than the Special Taxation on Pornographic Services and Marketing Using Telephones Act. But the acronym can also be overly contrived and forced, such as the recently introduced ""Eliminating Looting of Our Nation by Mitigating Unethical State Kleptocracy Act,"" or theELON MUSKAct.A backronym-named law can mask harmful policies by wrapping itself in flag-waiving euphemisms, as we learned with the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or theUSA PATRIOT Act.Other countries also struggle to address their obtuse government communications. George Robertson learned this lesson during his early tenure as the British secretary of state of defense. Withunrest in the Balkans and the Middle Eastthreatening international stability, Robertson took office during a tumultuous time. In addition to imminent global peril, Robertson wanted to address his agency's overuse of abbreviations. After listening to his boss's plan to simplify agency terminology, Robertson's chief of staff, Sir Charles Guthrie, leaned toward his boss andsaid, ""I think that you'll find solving Bosnia will be easier, Secretary of State.""French President Emmanuel Macron recently undertook the unenviable task of simplifying his country's ""labyrinthine bureaucracy."" ""We have nothing but acronyms,"" Macronsaidduring a meeting with French business leaders. ""It's awful."" After proposing consolidating multiple subsidies into one program,Revenu Universel d'Activité, Macron pleaded with his constituents not to abbreviate it. ""I ask you one favor: Don't call it RUA,"" said Macron. ""Acronyms lock people in boxes.""Abbreviations have increasingly entrapped our global vernacular. Australian scholars Adrian Barnett and Zoe Doubledayanalyzed24 million scholarly articles published between 1950 and 2019. Barnett and Doubleday found abbreviation usage more than doubled during that time. That growth was fourfold in abstracts alone. Interestingly, of the 1 million unique abbreviations Barnett and Doubleday identified, about 2,000—less than 1 percent—were repeated, meaning scholars are abbreviating for the sake of abbreviating. Most abbreviations—nearly 80 percent—appeared fewer than 10 times.""I may have grown up in the Age of Aquarius,""writesgrammarian Roy Peter Clark, ""but I'm growing old in the Age of the Acronym.""People 'H8' AbbreviationsResearch suggests most people agree with Musk: Abbreviations ""seriously suck.""David Fang, a doctoral student at Stanford University, found that people who use texting shorthand—LOL, BTW, BRB, TY, etc.—may struggle to communicate with others. ""We found that when people use abbreviations, others think they're putting in less effort, which makes them seem less sincere, and so they are less likely to get a response,"" said Fang.People's objection to abbreviations boils down to perception and cognition. Alyssa Appelman, a researcher and journalism professor at the University of Kansas, presented test subjects with similar news articles with manipulated headlines—e.g., ""National parks offer free admission for Martin Luther King Jr. Day"" vs. ""US parks offer free admission for MLK Day."" Appelmanfoundthat readers demonstrated increased frustration when reading the latter. ""Readers don't seem to be inherently bothered by the presence of acronyms in headlines,"" Appelman explains. ""They seem to be bothered by the ones they don't understand.""This frustration feeds into an overall distrust of institutions. Appelman demonstrated that those who struggled with the abbreviations already demonstrated a negative view of the media. Whether this trend is causative or correlative is unknown. But this self-perpetuating feedback loop certainly doesn't diminish their greater distrust. And withpublic trust in media and governmentat an all-time low, it's safe to assume this skepticism bleeds over into other legacy institutions.These negative perceptions also unnecessarily fuel our culture wars. Polling finds a wide partisan divide for abbreviations like DEI, CRT, and ESG. However, when researchersswappedabbreviations for their broader long-form versions (e.g., ""equity"" instead of DEI and ""sustainability"" instead of ESG), the partisan divide shrunk. Specificity—, something lacking in most abbreviations— may be part of the antidote to our political toxicity.Government Abbreviations Are Technically IllegalIn 1948, Sir Ernest Gowers, a decadeslong British civil servant, famously wrotePlain Words. The 94-page pamphlet—which popularized the famous maxim ""be short, be simple, be human""—kickstarted theplain language movement. For decades, this movement, with a penchant for clarity and brevity, has championed communications that laypeople could easily access and understand. More importantly, plain language opposes abbreviated government gobbledygook.It wasn't until recently that governments adopted and codified plain language standards. On October 13, 2010, President Barack Obama signed thePlain Writing Actinto law. The law required federal agencies to ""improve the effectiveness and accountability"" of federal agencies and promote communication that the ""public can understand and use."" The act also requires agencies to use plain writing in public-facing documents, train employees in ""plain writing"" practices and standards, and establish meaningful ways for the public to communicate with the agency.Plain language specifically targets abbreviations. The federal government's plain language website encourages government employees to ""keep it jargon-free."" Instead of abbreviations, government communication professionals should ""use full words"" (Vice President, not V.P.) or ""use an alternative"" (computer memory, not RAM). If abbreviations are necessary or if spelling them out ""would annoy your readers,"" plain language guidelines encourage writers to minimize abbreviations to ""a maximum of two a page.""Obviously, plain language is legally toothless. Government abbreviations are the equivalent of jaywalking: technically illegal but lightly policed. Ironically, the leading federal group—Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN)—identifies as a backronym.Abbreviations are not inherently wrong. When used to address broadly familiar entities like the FBI or EPA, abbreviations can save space and expedite communications.However, speed is useless when it lacks context. When used excessively, abbreviations can also be, as plain language expert Joseph Kimble put it, a ""menace to prose"" that distracts and confuses readers. Even worse, citizens can become so accustomed to jargon-dense, euphemistic language that they ignore policies that directly affect or harm them. Ask your average Joe whatNDAAstands for, and you'll be lucky if they can name the National Defense Authorization Act, let alone the billion-dollar megalomania it codifies.Tackling the federal bureaucracy and its overuse of abbreviations is not for the faint of heart. Considering the size and scope of the federal government and the need for congressional action to actually abolish federal agencies, Elon Musk certainly has his work cut out for him. And if reducing the size and scope of the federal government is a Herculean task, cutting government abbreviations will be Sisyphean.However, if they intend to procure legitimacy and garner public support, public officials must kick their nasty habit and heed thesage adviceof plain language advocates: ""Let abbreviations and acronyms RIP."""

Be AdaptableFinancial firms can stay relevant by embracing emerging technologies, prioritizing customer-centric solutions and fostering a culture of continuous learning. Agile strategies and proactive responses to market trends ensure resilience and sustained growth in a dynamic landscape. -Sumeet Grover,Alliant5. Integrate Technology With Legacy SystemsFinancial firms should embrace digital transformation that complements their legacy systems. This involves integrating advanced technologies like AI, cloud computing and blockchain to enhance efficiency, customer experience and security. By adopting agile practices and fostering innovation, firms can modernize operations while leveraging existing infrastructure to stay competitive. -Tomer Guriel,ezbob Ltd.Forbes Finance Councilis an invitation-only organization for executives in successful accounting, financial planning and wealth management firms.Do I qualify?6. Leverage AI For Smarter DecisionsFinancial firms can thrive in a rapidly evolving market by embracing AI-driven solutions that enhance decision-making, risk management and operational efficiency. Leveraging predictive analytics, automated reporting and real-time data insights empowers faster, data-backed decisions. AI also drives innovation in personalized client services, ensuring a competitive edge and long-term growth. -Zehra Soysal,Metaphysic.ai7. Adopt A Customer-Centric MindsetTo stay relevant, FSIs must embrace innovation, agility and customer-centricity. Leverage AI to deliver personalized experiences, adopt sustainable practices and stay ahead of regulatory shifts. Foster a culture of continuous learning and adaptability to navigate emerging trends. By investing in tech, talent and trust, FSIs can meet evolving demands and thrive in a dynamic financial landscape. -Monica Hovsepian,OpenText8. Build Immersive Financial EcosystemsFinancial firms can redefine relevance by creating immersive financial ecosystems using metaverse technologies, offering virtual advisory, gamified financial literacy and NFT-based asset trading. Integrating quantum computing for ultra-accurate risk modeling and pioneering AI-driven predictive wealth strategies can position them as leaders in an unpredictable, tech-first future. -Swati Deepak Kumar (Nema),Citigroup9. Never Stop LearningThe secret to relevance? Adaptability fueled by continuous learning. Prioritize learning and development to equip your team with the tools to evolve, and they’ll rise to every challenge. Pair this with a values-driven culture to unify your firm and confidently navigate uncertainty. -Sonya Thadhani Mughal,Bailard, Inc.10. Communicate Your Technological AdvantageNot only do financial firms need to invest in the latest technology and talent to maintain the pace, they need to be able to communicate this to the marketplace. Potential clients are becoming more and more savvy every year, and they are constantly being bombarded with messages about the latest and greatest technology. Customers need to know how your technological prowess can help them. -David T. Nudelman,Scandinavian Capital Markets11. Take Steps Toward SustainabilityIncorporate sustainability in the company's impact advisory strategy to leverage impact investment funding for their clients. Build innovative solutions in the sectors driving transformative growth in the financial sector. -Oluwatoyin Aralepo,Africa Finance & Strategy Hub12.

Transparent communication and ethical leadership build trust, aligning with stakeholder expectations in a rapidly evolving world. -Shivali Kukreja,NIB NZ13. Invest In Future TrendsFinancial firms must embrace innovation, agility and sustainability to stay ahead. Leveraging AI and data analytics enhances decision-making, while flexible strategies help navigate market shifts. A strong focus on ESG, digital transformation and customer-centric solutions ensures long-term relevance. Firms that adapt quickly and invest in future trends will maintain a competitive edge. -Aurele Gouy,Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield14. Keep An Eye On The CompetitionPaying attention to your competition is one way financial firms can ensure they stay relevant in a rapidly changing world. Staying aware of what competitors are doing can help you identify things that you can do to enhance your operation and things to avoid. It's also important to constantly look for technology that can create efficiency and enhance the customer experience. -Joseph Myer,Courser Capital Management, LLC15. Focus On Solving Real ProblemsTo stay relevant, we must understand what has changed and what hasn’t. Core customer pain points rarely change, so focus on solving real problems instead of chasing trends your customers don’t need. New product development often involves combining existing offerings or recycling old products with new technologies to deliver greater value and better meet customer needs. -Lechi (Richard) Zhang,Angel Investor16. Prioritize Trust And RelationshipsFinancial firms stay relevant by focusing on what doesn’t change: trust, relationships and delivering value. Clients need guidance, clarity and someone who understands their goals. By adopting tools to enhance these strengths, focusing on owning a particular niche and bringing hospitality, which is often missed in tech-driven solutions, firms can build deep expertise and remain indispensable. -Patrick Lonergan,Vital Wealth17. Understand Your MarketStaying relevant has never been more important. Look at the bankruptcies of the last year, like Red Lobster. Rather than innovate, they coasted on previous success and, ultimately, found themselves losing because of it. Relevance requires an understanding of your market. Your company should shift along with your audience to best meet their needs as your audience shifts. -Joe Camberato,National Business Capital18. Blend Technology With Human InsightThe family office space is a mix of technology and strategic foresight, where advisors are data scientists, empaths and futurists. Those who integrate new tech with personalized service will lead. However, while AI and digital tools improve efficiency, nothing can substitute human connections. Advisors who focus on client goals and emotional drivers will be both financial strategists and even life coaches. -Royce Ramey,Versant Capital Management19. Stay True To Your ValuesStaying relevant requires embracing innovation but remaining guided by your core values. Being adaptable to rapid changes allows financial firms to meet client needs with real-time insight. Remaining faithful to your values and mission informs those changes meaningfully to bring value to the services and financial education the firm provides. -Jared Weitz,United Capital Source Inc.20. Cultivate Agility To Meet Client NeedsFinancial firms can stay relevant by fostering a culture of agility and deeply understanding evolving client needs. By leveraging data insights and embracing digital transformation, they can stay ahead of market shifts. Focusing on personalized, customer-centric solutions and cross-functional collaboration ensures firms not only adapt but lead in the everchanging financial landscape. -Anushree Jain,TitanThe information provided here is not investment, tax, or financial advice.

Is Your 403(b) And Roth IRA Retirement Investing Supporting Predatory Lenders?,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jbrewer/2025/02/25/is-your-403b-and-roth-ira-retirement-investing-supporting-predatory-lenders/,"MoneyPersonal FinanceIs Your 403(b) And Roth IRA Retirement Investing Supporting Predatory Lenders?ByJames Brewer, Contributor.Empowering smarter money moves.Follow AuthorFeb 25, 2025, 05:42pm ESTSave ArticleCommentUnsuspecting couple talking with potential predatory lender.gettyWhen I talk to prospects and clients about retirement investing, no one usually thinks about what companies are inside their portfolio. They often have a shocked reaction thinking that they might be making money on the backs of the unfortunate prey of predatory lenders. Research provider YourStake defines predatory lending as “Companies that have received 25 or more Consumer Financial Protection Bureau complaints for predatory lending complaints, includingpayday loans, installment loans, pawn loans, title loans, tax refund anticipation loans, personal lines of credit, and check cashing, over the last 3 years."" In this article, we break down how this can happen and offer guidance on making smarter, values-aligned choices for your retirement investing.What Is Retirement Investing?Retirement investing refers to the strategies and tools used to build a nest egg that can support you once you stop working. Common vehicles include employer-sponsored plans like 401(k) and 403(b) plans, as well as individual accounts such asRoth IRAsand rollover IRAs.Many investors choose mutual funds ortarget date fundswithin these accounts. While these funds are managed by reputable companies like Vanguard, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price, the underlying research and investment selections may not always align with your personal values. The way an index fund may be created might include companies that generate significant revenue from predatory lending practices.How Predatory Lending Can Slip Inside Of Your InvestingThe majority of people find themselves investing for their retirement, inside of mutual funds through their employer sponsored retirement plans. These plans can take the form of 401(k), 403(b), SEP IRA and others. In these plans, your employer facilitates the saving and investing by coordinating with a payroll company, custodian, and investment provider. Often employers hire a financial advisor (either aregistered representativeor aninvestment advisor representative). Often times, well-meaning employers will reach out to directly investment companies like Vanguard and Fidelity, foregoing a financial professional. They often pick investment companies known for their brand names as mutual fund providers. While this should cut costs to the employee, it exposes the company and its fiduciaries to unshared or distributed risk with a professional fiduciary.They typically select funds from well-known companies based on cost efficiency without consideration for ethical research. As a result, funds that replicate broad market indexes without thorough screening can include companies that benefit from predatory lending practices.MORE FOR YOUCourt Lets Trump Fire Watchdog Chief For Now: Here’s Where Trump And Musk Are Winning—And Losing—In Court‘Hamilton’ Cancels Kennedy Center Show Run In Protest Of Trump’s ‘Purge’Fox News Sets Record As Trump’s Speech Draws 32 Million ViewersI recently worked with an economic justice nonprofit that specifically focuses on eliminating anti-predatory lending. In fact, they have fought for legislation that has helped either eliminate or reduce the impact of predatory lenders. When I started working with them, they proudly said that they were working with Vanguard through a direct relationship. Typically, most employers pick the target date mutual funds of the investment provider that they work with. This company had done the same. While many people exalt, the value of reducing the fees inside of investments, they don’t have the investment research to question whether or not that is actually the best option (see my fee adjusted returnsarticle).This organization, that proudly partnered with Vanguard due to its low fees, discovered that their investments inadvertently included companies benefiting from predatory lending. This raised serious questions about the real cost of chasing lower fees without understanding what lies behind the index funds.In their pursuit for looking out for they employees, this organization had unknowingly allowed predatory lenders to slip into their investments, compromising their own mission statement.How Does That Happen?Unlike companies like Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, Vanguard is in the business of replicating research that it gets from other research providers. For example, the often referencedS&P 500simply is research from Standard and Poor’s. They take all of the publicly traded companies across the world and do various analysis. The S&P 500 is one of the most basic. It simply is the largest by market capitalization 500 companies in the United States. It doesn’t question what business or businesses these companies are involved in. It simply rank orders them by size.As you might expect, there are companies that have a substantial amount of their business derived from predatory lending. That doesn’t mean that their company name includes the words predatory lending. In fact, I’ve yet to find someone who has actually investigated what they’re actually invested in. The Vanguard target mutual fund series link ishere.The As You SowInvest Your Values401(k) website rates target mutual funds. If you go to the page where the subheading is, you’ll see that index funds usually get an F grade as they don’t have built in exclusions in their prospectus. Non excluding companies on the basis of not fitting a social criteria doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re gonna make any more money. Fidelity and T. Rowe Price for example, do not follow Vanguard‘s lead. They spend time and research deciding which companies to include and not to include in their investments. This is known as active investing.The MSCI KLD index is an index that has been combed for certain values. You can find more information on itherealong with its methodology. iShares makes it possible to invest in this index.Understanding 403(b) And Roth IRA OptionsMany employees participate in 403(b) plans, especially those working in education, healthcare, or non-profit sectors. A 403(b) is similar to a 401(k) but is tailored to certain organizations. The investment options available within a 403(b) might mirror those in a 401(k), including mutual funds and target date funds. However, if the chosen fund does not screen out companies engaged in predatory practices, you could be supporting business models that are not in line with your values.Similarly, a Roth IRA is an individual retirement account where contributions are made with after-tax dollars. The money in a Roth IRA grows tax-free, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free. Because Roth IRAs are typically self-directed, investors have the flexibility to choose funds that align with their ethical standards. You might decide to invest in funds that consciously avoid companies with ties to predatory lending practices.Is It Necessary To Invest In Predatory Lenders To Make Money?First, I compare the Russell 1000 index versus the MSCI KLD index and a custom developed index based on excluding predatory lenders (YourStake Anti-predatory). You can quickly see the substantially better values adjusted returns for the KLD and the Anti-predatory, lending custom index from YourStake.Values Alignment Chart for Predatory LendingYourStake.orgWhat About The Effect On Returns?Hypothetical 10-year return ""look back"" chartYourStake.orgYou see that the Anti-Predatory did the best with the Russell 1000 slightly besting the KLD. In this case, YourStake considered companies from the MSCI All Country World Index. The MSCI ACWI captures 2,647 large and mid-cap representations across 23 Developed Markets and 24 Emerging Markets countries. The Russell 1000 only considers the largest 1,000 U.S. Companies and the MSCI KLD extracts 400 companies from 2,312 U.S. Companies (MSCI USA IMI)*.While companies most often look for a qualified default investment alternative to aid their employees and investing for retirement, there are more choices than simply the target date mutual fund. I prefer asset allocation funds or balance funds. Asset allocation funds align to a specified static combination of stocks and bonds. For example, 65% stock and 35% bond. Balanced funds typically have a 60% stock and 40% bond and significantly pre-date the target date fund.Making Smarter Choices For Your RetirementSo, what should you do if you’re concerned about the potential inclusion of predatory lending in your retirement investments? Here are a few practical steps:Review Your Funds:Research companies likeThe American Friends Service Committeeand As You Sow allow you to screen for certain values. Look for any mention of screening criteria related to social concerns like predatory lending.Consult With A Trusted Financial Advisor:It is vital to work with a financial advisor who understands both your financial needs and your ethical concerns. You could also look for advisors with this focus and that have access to research such as that from YourStake. InvestmentNews is even capturing anESG Advisorin its Advisor of the Year Categories. First Affirmative is anothernetwork of advisorsaligned with this practice.Leverage Self-Directed Accounts:If you have a Roth IRA or a rollover IRA, consider choosing funds or individual stocks that match your ethical standards. Self-directed accounts give you more control over your investment choices. It can be the reason you decide to rollover an old 401(k) or 403(b).Concluding Thoughts On Predatory Lending And Retirement InvestingIt’s much easier to exclude predatory lending from your retirement investing if your retirement money is in a rollover IRA or Roth IRA. If you are an employer selecting investments for your employees, you should be thinking about whether or not predatory lending might have you seen by your employees negatively. This and many other issues may push your employees not to invest at all.Retirement investing should be about more than just chasing returns—it’s about building a secure future that also reflects your personal values. By taking a closer look at the funds in your portfolio, you can avoid unknowingly supporting companies engaged in predatory lending. Whether you’re saving in a 403(b), a Roth IRA, or a 401(k), make sure you understand where your money is going and the research behind those investments.If you’re a employer, a retirement plan is to be for the benefit of the employee. Forcing them into something that goes against their interests and beliefs does not completely keep their interest in mind. I believe you owe it to your employees to at least consider issues like predatory lending in the decision-making process of your investment menu. This is especially true if you are an organization like the one discussed earlier, where your charter may have a social aim.With careful research and the right guidance, you can build a portfolio that not only grows your wealth but also stays true to your values. In the end, a well-considered approach to retirement investing will provide you with financial security and peace of mind for years to come.Follow me onLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.*The performance of the YSO hypothetical lookback ishypotheticaland doesn't guarantee any future results.*The YSO portfolio returns are presented without considering fees, whereas the funds would have expense ratios.*Comparing individual securities vs. funds in a portfolio snapshot is subject to ""survivorship bias"".

(昨年22ブランド)、逆に二桁マイナスのブランドが8ブランド (昨年 4ブランド) となるなど、明暗が分かれたToyotaがBest Japan Brandsで17年連続の第1位ASICSが28% 増で最高の成長率Tokyo Electron、ITOCHU、Don Quijote、SBI、ANA、Marugame Seimenの６ブランドが初ランクイン社会価値と経済価値の両立、顧客やステークホルダーとの共創による価値の創造、顧客の享受価値に根差した事業領域の拡張などを実践するブランドが伸長日本最大級のブランディング会社である株式会社インターブランドジャパン（東京都港区、代表取締役会⻑兼社⻑兼CEO：並木将仁）は、ブランドの持つ価値を金額換算する独自のブランド価値評価（Brand ValuationTM）の手法を用い、日本発のブランドを対象としたブランド価値ランキング「Best Japan Brands 2025」を発表いたしました。今年で17回目の発表となるBest Japan Brandsは、インターブランドが2000年より毎年発表するグローバルのブランド価値ランキングBest Global Brands と共通の評価方法を用いており、グローバルのリーディングブランドと日本ブランドの価値を同じモノサシで比較することで、ビジネスの資産としてのブランド価値を世界基準で考察します。ブランドが顧客に対して提供する価値だけではなく、現在そして未来の社会に対する役割や責任に関する活動の評価として、環境・社会・ガバナンス（ESG）データを導⼊し分析しています。Best Japan Brands 2025概況劇的な進化を続けるテクノロジーによる未来への期待が日々生まれている一方で、年を追うごとに進むさまざまな格差や各地で表出する分断、山積する社会課題など、「不確実で見通せなかった」将来への不安な面が次々と顕在化しています。人々は、もはや政治家やレガシーメディアを信用せず 、社会システムの崩壊をも予感し、これまで以上に不安や不満、時に怒りや憤りを感じ、行動に移す時代へと変容しつつあります。 そのような背景の中、Best Japan Brands 2025にランクインした全100ブランド個別の対前年成長率の平均は+4.6％（昨年は+4.8％の成長）、全100ブランドのブランド価値総額は、3,142億ドル（前年比+7.7%、昨年は同+6.7%）となり、ブランドは徐々に成長しています。この全体傾向は、2024年10月に発表されたBest Global Brands 2024（昨年比+5%）と同様です。今回、ブランド価値を大きく伸長させたブランドの共通点を分析すると、「ブランド強度分析（※P6参照）」の10要素のうち、Agility（俊敏力：組織としてビジネス機会や課題に対応し、期待を超え続けるため迅速に動くことができるか）、Affinity（愛着度：ブランドが提供する機能的・情緒的価値や価値観の共有により、顧客が絆を感じてくれているか）、Empathy（共感力：組織として顧客や他のステークホルダーの声を積極的に聞き、その進化するニーズ・想い・欲求を先んじて予測し、それに応える能力を備えているか）が高い傾向が確認されています。外部環境への迅速・柔軟な対応の重要性は引き続き変わりませんが、政治や経済、環境問題などにおける逆⾵に⽴ち向かい、生活者一人ひとりと向き合いながら社会や人々の本質 (真理) を捉えること、そしてどのような未来を実現すのかを明確に提示しながら、人々とともに創り上げていく、従来とは異なる、新たなステージでの「ヒューマン・セントリック」を実践することが、ブランド成長の鍵となっています。Top 5 Growing Brands（前年比ブランド価値成長率 Top 5）ASICS（46位、前年比+28%）ASICSは、創業哲学「健全な身体に健全な精神があれかし－“Anima Sana In Corpore Sano”」を元に、ブランドスローガン「Sound Mind, Sound Body」を設定し、ASICSとしてのすべての判断基準となっています。また、ビジョン “Create Quality Lifestyle through Intelligent Sport Technology”（スポーツでつちかった知的技術により、質の高いライフスタイルを創造する）により「誰もが一生涯、運動・スポーツに関わり、心と身体が健康で居続けられる世界の実現」を目指しています。2024年より始動した「中期経営計画2026」では、「グローバル×デジタル」の更なる推進を通じて、本社と地域事業会社の連携を一層強化し「Global Integrated Enterprise」への変革を進めています。また、デジタルの強化により、会員の健康やスポーツをサポートするロイヤリティプログラム「OneASICS」を展開。消費者の生活へのASICSブランドの浸透と定着が推進されています。Mitsui Fudosan（60位、前年比+26%）Mitsui Fudosanは、2024年に経営理念を再定義し、新グループ長期経営方針「& INNOVATION 2030」と、コーポレートメッセージ「さあ、街から未来をかえよう」を策定、グループロゴの「&マーク」もリニューアルすることで、Mitsui Fudosanの進む方向性を、わかりやすく、具体的に表明しました。「日本橋に森をつくる」 “終わらない森”創りとしての国内最大・最高層の木造賃貸オフィスビル、「スポーツの力」を活用した街づくりとして大型多目的アリーナ施設「LaLa arena TOKYO-BAY」などに加え、日本橋でのアジア最大級の宇宙ビジネスイベント「NIHONBASHI SPACE WEEK 2023」やライフサイエンス領域でのコミュニティ「LINK-J」の構築などの新産業創造にも積極的に取り組むなど、コーポレートメッセージを具現化したサービスやイベントの開発を次々に展開。積極的で一貫性のあるコミュニケーションとともに、社会価値の創出する「産業デベロッパー」ブランドとして、グループを挙げてコーポレートブランドの強化に取り組んでいます。Recruit（13位、前年比+24%）Recruitは、基本理念として、新しい価値の創造を通じ、社会からの期待に応え、一人ひとりが輝く豊かな世界の実現を目指しています。そして、目指す世界観「Follow Your Heart」（一人ひとりが、自分に素直に、自分で決める、自分らしい人生。）、果たす役割「まだ、ここにない、出会い。より速く、シンプルに、もっと近くに。」を掲げ、変化するグローバル市場や技術の進化に柔軟かつ持続的に対応し、AI技術を基盤にしたビジネスの進化を遂げています。人と仕事をつなぐ「Hot Pepper Beauty Work」「リクナビ」「リクナビNEXT」、住まいと人をつなぐ「SUUMO」など、迅速かつ正確なマッチングシステムにより競争力を高め、国内からグローバルまで信頼を獲得し、ブランド力を強化しています。また、オンライン教育サービス「スタディサプリ」でグッドデザイン賞を受賞するなど、新しい価値創造にも成功しています。Hitachi（26位、前年比+24%）Hitachiは、IT（Information Technology）×OT （Operational Technology）×プロダクトを活用して、お客さまとともに社会課題を解決する「社会イノベーション事業」を推進。2016年より、その基盤となるデジタル技術やナレッジ、ビジネスモデルなどを結集した仕掛け・仕組みLumadaを展開。Lumadaを活用した顧客協創を通じて、お客さまのDXを迅速に実現し、新たな価値を創出し続けてきました。「デジタル」「グリーン」「イノベーション」を成長の原動力と位置づけ、社会イノベーション事業を加速させることで、世界中の人々が望む良いこと、すなわち“GOOD“の実現を目指しています。「Hitachi Social Innovation Forum 2024 JAPAN」を開催し、Hitachiの取り組みを対外的に紹介。YouTubeにおいて「HITACHI Brand Channel」オフィシャルチャネルを開設。毎月10本以上の動画を公開し、毎年増え続けているチャンネル登録者数は7.44万人（2024年10月時点）に達し、ブランドの存在感が増しています。ORIX（71位、前年比+22%）ORIXは、創立60周年の2024年に向けて、さらなる成長のトリガーとなるグローバルビジネス拡大のためには、ORIXの企業風土や強みをグローバルに共有することが重要と考え、１年半をかけて多くの様々な社内外の人々とORIX Groupらしさや創りたい未来、社会における存在意義を議論。2023年11月に「ORIX Group Purpose & Culture」としてパーパス（存在意義）「変化に挑み、柔軟な発想と知の融合で、未来をひらくインパクトを。」、Culture（価値観）「多様性を力に変える。」「挑戦をおもしろがる。」「変化にチャンスを見出す。」を制定し、ブランドの方向性を刷新しました。それにより多様な事業を展開するグループ内のつながりが強化され、よりORIXブランドの持つ強みが発揮できる環境となり、成長につながっています。また、「価値創造モデル」や「バリューアップモデル」も策定され、成長のためのプロセスが具体的に明示。このような施策により、ブランドの社内外への可視化と強化が加速されています。New Entrants（初ランクイン）Tokyo Electron（53位）Tokyo Electronは、基本理念に「最先端の技術と確かなサービスで、夢のある社会の発展に貢献します」を掲げ、革新的かつ多様な技術力・顧客との絶対的な信頼関係・環境変化に柔軟に対応できる社員とそのチャレンジ精神を持つ、半導体製造装置のグローバルリーディングカンパニーとしての地位を確立しつつあります。2023年11月に創立60周年を迎え、「半導体の技術革新に貢献する夢と活力のある会社」として、幅広いステークホルダーにその存在感を高めています。ITOCHU（93位）ITOCHUは、企業理念「三方よし」のもと、2024年に長期の羅針盤としての経営方針「The Brand-new Deal～利は川下にあり～」を制定しました。その柱の一つとして「企業ブランド価値の向上＝定性面の磨き」を掲げ、「マーケットイン」の発想のもと、人的資本・ステークホルダーとの対話・SDGsへの貢献の強化といった地道な定性面の磨きの継続により、ブランド価値の更なる向上を目指しています。Don Quijote（94位）Don

Japan Brands 2025 (1-50位)Best Japan Brands 2025 (51-100位)Best Japan Brands 2025のブランド価値評価について評価対象基準グローバルに展開される日本発のブランドについて、そのブランド価値を明らかにし、「世界共通の尺度」で、そのポジションを相対比較することを目的に、以下の基準を満たすブランドを抽出し評価します。日本発のブランドであること：日本の企業によって生み出されたコーポレートおよび事業ブランドであること各種財務情報が公表されていること、または監査済みの財務情報が入手可能なこと日本で一般に認知されていること資本コストを織り込んだエコノミックプロフィットが長期的にポジティブであること「Best Global Brands 2024」ランクインブランドは 2024年のブランド価値金額を適用評価手法インターブランドのブランド価値評価手法は、財務力、ブランドが購買意思決定に与える影響力、そしてブランドによる将来収益の確かさ、という観点からみたブランド価値の評価です。証券アナリストが事業の価値を分析・評価するのと同じように、「将来どれくらい収益を上げると予想されるか」という視点に基づいて、ブランドの価値を分析・評価します。この手法は、ブランドの金銭的価値測定のための世界標準として、国際標準化機構(ISO)からISO10668の認定を受けています。評価は、具体的に以下の 3 つの分析によって構成されています。1. 「財務分析」 - 企業が生み出す利益の将来予測を行うまず、ブランドを冠する事業を特定し、その事業の現在の売上および将来の売上予測を算出します。そして、その売上から営業費用、税金、そして投下資本に応じた資本コストを差し引き、現在から将来にわたる経済的利益を推計します。本分析は、公開されている、または監査済みの企業情報を基に、将来予測はアナリストによる業績予想（※）を参考にしています。※ 本評価のアナリストの業績予想は、IFISコンセンサスデータhttps://www.ifis.co.jp/より取得したアナリストによる将来予測を用いています。将来予測については、2024年10月25日時点のものを採用しています。2. 「ブランドの役割分析」 - 利益のうち、ブランドの貢献分を抽出する財務分析で算出された将来の経済的利益のうち、ブランドによってもたらされた利益を抽出するために、ブランドがどの程度顧客の購買意思決定に影響を与えているかを分析します。 本評価においては、ブランドが消費者の購買動向に果たす役割について、インターブランドが過去20年以上にわたり実施した10,000を超えるブランド価値評価実績のデータベースを活用し、業界別にベンチマークを設定します。そして業界ベンチマークを基にして、独自の調査・分析により個別ブランドの“ブランドの貢献分”のスコアを算出します。3. 「ブランド強度分析」 - ブランドによる利益の将来の確実性を評価するブランド強度分析は、市場でのロイヤリティ、消費者の継続購入、消費者の囲い込みといった消費者のニーズを喚起する力(将来の収益を維持する力)を測り、ブランドによる利益を割り引くための係数を出すものです。 この評価は、ブランドのリスクを判断する体系的な手法であり、ブランドの強度を見る10の項目から評価され、100をパーフェクトブランドとする0から100までのスコアで表されます。これらの項目の評価は同業種の他のブランドと比較して行われ、上位ブランドについては他業種を含めた世界レベルのブランドと比較して行われます。このブランド強度スコアは、インターブランド独自の計算手法により、割引率に変換され、その「割引率」で 将来のブランド利益を割り引くことで、ブランド価値が算定されます。「ブランドの役割分析」および「ブランド強度分析」は、公表されているさまざまな報告書等を使用し、弊社グローバル各オフィスの専門コンサルタントの多面的な評価を踏まえ算定されます。※本評価にはESGの観点も加味しており、東洋経済新報社『CSR企業総覧（ESG編）2024年版』を活用しております。※本評価の対象期間は2023年10⽉1⽇から2024年9⽉30⽇です。インターブランドジャパンについてインターブランドジャパンは、ロンドン、ニューヨークに次ぐ、インターブランド第3の拠点として、

"Conspiracy Theorists Were Right About Everything, by Brandon Smith","{'id': None, 'name': 'Survivalblog.com'}",https://survivalblog.com/2025/02/23/conspiracy-theorists-were-right-about-everything-by-brandon-smith/,"Conspiracy Theorists Were Right About Everything, by Brandon SmithSurvivalBlog ContributorFebruary 23, 2025February 21, 2025For many years alternative economists and “conspiracy theorists” have argued that, according to the evidence, there has been an organized criminal cabal operating a long-running agenda to exploit and eventually destroy western culture. We have suggested that much of this agenda was being funded with our own tax dollar while using government institutions and NGOs as vehicles for social engineering.In the 20 years since I started work in the liberty movement (or patriot movement), I have seen corruption beyond imagining and it all culminated in 2020-2023 when many of us battled against the imposition of total medical tyranny and mass woke indoctrination. Even after that startling Orwellian period we were still called conspiracy theorists, but public awareness is changing rapidly.I’ve seen enough to know that what is happening today is truly unprecedented. We have entered a crossroads; a time when reality is no longer discarded for the sake of collective comfort and “conspiracy” becomes historic fact. It’s an exciting time to be alive, but also potentially hazardous.My running theory has always been that once the house of cards came crashing down and the truth was revealed to the wider public, a whole lot of skeptics that used to call us “fringe crazies” and “tinfoil hatters” would suddenly claim they “saw it coming all along”. Yes, the conspiracy theorists were right, abouteverything. The truth is coming to light in a big way, but what does this mean for the future?Can America Handle The Truth?The recent dismantling of USAID and the open investigations into numerous federal agencies has opened a Pandora’s Box; the covert funding that these institutions are involved in (including millions in pay-offs to various news media outlets and propaganda platforms) is, I believe, just the tip of a massive iceberg that could very well sink the US system faster than the Titanic.Elon Musk’s DOGE group has only just begun dipping their toes into the dark waters of the Treasury, Medicaid, Social Security, and the Defense Department. We all know there are some horrifying monsters lurking in those depths. This doesn’t even take into account the hidden activities of the controllers of the Federal Reserve.The establishment media argues that USAID represents only 1% of the total federal budget, as if that makes the budget waste acceptable. But if there is that much mismanagement and gerrymandering in a smaller organization like USAID, imagine how much fraud there is in the rest of the federal government?Over the years many of us in alternative economics have wondered if our nation would be able to handle the revelation that almost everything about our system is fake. Half the country has suspected as much, but what would happen if we had hard proof – A smoking gun?USAID is that smoking gun, the proof of death, but it’s only one of many buried bodies that are about to be uncovered. The real revelations will come when DOGE discovers how much US policy is directed and controlled by entitiesoutsideof our own country.What happens when they investigate the numerous financial and political networks connected to the WEF, Davos, World Bank, the IMF, the BIS, and international think tanks like the CFR, Tavistock, the Atlantic Council, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, and Open Society Foundations? What about the investment influences of Black Rock, Vanguard, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, etc.?When the globalist hand behind the revolving door of cash is revealed, when the shadow government becomes a concrete and undeniable fact, is the public going freak out?The political left is an enemy of freedom and morality, yes, but the greater issue is that they are a useful tool for more powerful elitist interests. It’s a cartel, an oligarchy working together to bring down the west from within and replace it with something new. A new ideology and a new economy that would effectively turn the majority of the population into unwitting serfs.Only four years ago the WEF was boasting about the coming of the “4thIndustrial Revolution”, the rise of the “cashless society”, the “Fifteen Minute City” and the “Sharing Economy”. And, as we now know, many of those projects were being paid for with our tax dollars. The globalists were so convinced that they had the populace dead to rights. They thought they had won.It was only through the tireless efforts of liberty movement activists and conservatives around the world that the plan was disrupted and the globalists were sent into retreat. However, the fight is far from over. There are some important problems that need to be addressed as we enter the era of transparency. Here’s what will probably happen next…Rabid Sabotage By The Political LeftThe government is effectively being audited by the Trump Administration, and the Democrats are enraged. Why? Because they (and a handful of Neo-Cons) know full well what that audit is going to find. Activist judges and progressive politicians are going to obstruct and interfere with the process as much as they can. Their entire power structure depends on the steady embezzlement of tax dollars and the constant churning of the fiat printing press.For those people who don’t understand what the big deal is with USAID, I suggest they research ESG programs and what they do. USAID was basically a vehicle for global ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance; a meaningless acronym designed to hide a program for global socialism) and it was spending incredible sums of money to spread woke propaganda into every facet of our society.Leftist legal actions won’t make much difference in the long run, but they’ll still try to delay. These delays will be used to buy time for media spin. They’re going full force to misrepresent DOGE as some kind of totalitarian entity “destroying democracy”, however, authoritarians have never and will never pursue government transparency; this is not a thing.  Authoritariansalwayspursue obscurity and occult secrecy around their activities. The leftists, by their own actions, are exposed as the true totalitarians.Democrats and establishment NGOs will continue trying to foment civil unrest and they will use woke dupes as cannon fodder in this fight. Anything to distract the public from the evidence of their criminality.  Violence and terrorism should be expected.Economic Downturn Is Inevitable – Trump Will Be BlamedBroad budget cuts are essential to saving the economy in the long term, but they are also a double-edged sword in the short term. For example, US GDP stats rely greatly on government spending in their calculations (they shouldn’t, but they do). Government spending accounts for around 36% of our nation’s GDP – It’s a methodology used in recent decades to make our economic health look stronger than it really is.As Trump executes extensive cuts to government spending, this will in turn make it look as if GDP is plummeting. Leftists will claim that Trump’s policies are crashing the financial system.On top of this,I’ve been warning for some timethat the Biden Administration has been engaging in complex data manipulation. Now that Biden is gone the real data is already coming out and it’s not good. Inflation numbers and employment numbers from the Biden era are being “adjusted”, as I predicted, showing a much weaker economy than originally reported. Retail stats and GDP are next.The American public will need a crash course in how the economy works and who is behind the downturn, or the leftist media will have a field day with the revised stats.Can The Investment World Handle The Truth?When the level of fraud within the US system is fully exposed, will the investment world panic? Will they pull their money out of US markets that have long been supported artificially by government funds and central bank intervention? These are valid questions we need to consider. The truth needs to come out regardless; nothing can be fixed until the source of the rot is uncovered. That said, the mantra “ignorance is bliss” is one that America has been living by for a long time.I think Americans are desperate for the truth and desperate for reform, but change on the scale we are facing always brings chaos with it. I suggest that conservatives and patriots prepare accordingly.Cutting Ties With Globalist-Run GovernmentsAs the process of transparency moves forward in the US we have to take into account that Europe, the UK, Australia, and Canada are all still well under the hypnosis of the cabal. Things are changing overseas; the UK, Germany, and France are starting to see conservative movements blossom, but globalists are determined to stop them from gaining political traction.I suspect we will see strained or broken ties with many former allies in the coming years as they crack down on their own citizens and show their true authoritarian colors. We’re already seeing this happening in the UK, Germany, France, and Romania among others.The Most Dangerous Time Is When You Think You Are WinningEstablishment elites are like vampires. In fact, I suspect the whole mythology of vampires from centuries ago is actually based on the very real and evil crimes of the elites of the past. They use their wealth and influence to gain a foothold in your country, city, or village. They use subterfuge to gain trust and exert authority. They spread darkness and corruption like a cancer, then they feed on the population at will while pretending to be benevolent leaders.But these parasites must be invited in by the people. The public has to, in some ways, give consent to their own victimization. We have to willfully ignore their activities; our apathy is seen as consent. Sunlight is the primary remedy and the vampires flee when it’s unleashed. Finally, if all else fails a stake through the heart is required to end them. It could be a proverbial stake, or a very real one.Audits of the corrupt system are the sunlight. Independent patriot rebellion is the stake through the heart if all else fails.Just because the evil is exposed does not necessarily mean that it will stop or disappear. Often these cornered creatures fight even harder and their mission is to take you down with them. Great truth often precedes the darkest of days and the collapse of epochs. As the shadow government faces uncertainty for perhaps the first time ever, who knows how the leviathan will react?—About The Author:Brandon Smith is a frequent guest contributor to SurvivalBlog.

EU fund managers churn out defence funds once deemed uninvestable,"{'id': 'the-times-of-india', 'name': 'The Times of India'}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/eu-fund-managers-churn-out-defence-funds-once-deemed-uninvestable/articleshow/118516255.cms,"AgenciesThe S&P Global 1200 Aerospace & Defense Index rose 17% last year and is up 6% so far this year.As governments across Europe ratchet up defence spending, money managers who previously judged the sector too controversial to touch are taking note.There's currently a proliferation of portfolios focused on defence assets, with fund tickers such as WAR and NATO doing the rounds. Data compiled by Bloomberg shows the number of defence-themed funds doubled last year to a record 47, following decades during which such products - if they existed at all - were only to be found in the single digits. Data through mid-February indicates the current pace isn't letting up.And in a sign of the times, even investors focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics are now softening once strict exclusion policies to make room for defence assets.Mia Thulstrup Gedbjerg, who co-heads the defence industry unit at the Danish law firm Kromann Reumert, said it's as if ""D is the new addition to ESG.""Europe is now racing to respond to the reset in trans-Atlantic relations triggered by President Donald Trump's return to the White House. Across the bloc, governments are planning major increases to defence spending and discussing new funding models to pay for it.Stock TradingMaximise Returns by Investing in the Right CompaniesBy - The Economic Times, Get Certified By India's Top Business News BrandView ProgramStock TradingRenko Chart Patterns Made EasyBy - Kaushik Akiwatkar, Derivative Trader and InvestorView ProgramStock TradingCandlesticks Made Easy: Candlestick Pattern CourseBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView ProgramStock TradingDow Theory Made EasyBy - Vishal Mehta, Independent Systematic TraderView ProgramStock TradingMarket 101: An Insight into Trendlines and MomentumBy - Rohit Srivastava, Founder- Indiacharts.comView ProgramStock TradingMarkets 102: Mastering Sentiment Indicators for Swing and Positional TradingBy - Rohit Srivastava, Founder- Indiacharts.comView ProgramStock TradingMarket 103: Mastering Trends with RMI and Techno-Funda InsightsBy - Rohit Srivastava, Founder- Indiacharts.comView ProgramStock TradingMarket 104: Options Trading: Kickstart Your F&O AdventureBy - Saketh R, Founder- QuickAlpha, Full Time Options TraderView ProgramStock TradingROC Made Easy: Master Course for ROC Stock IndicatorBy - Souradeep Dey, Equity and Commodity Trader, TrainerView ProgramStock TradingRSI Made Easy: RSI Trading CourseBy - Souradeep Dey, Equity and Commodity Trader, TrainerView ProgramStock TradingTechnical Analysis for Everyone - Technical Analysis CourseBy - Abhijit Paul, Technical Research Head, Fund Manager- ICICI SecuritiesView ProgramStock TradingIntroduction to Technical Analysis & Candlestick TheoryBy - Dinesh Nagpal, Full Time Trader, Ichimoku & Trading Psychology ExpertView ProgramFor investors, the issue of regional security, combined with the likelihood of big returns, is hard to ignore. ""A lot of capital is going to flow into these companies,"" Gedbjerg said.Roel Houwer, senior product manager at VanEck Asset Management, said public opinion around the appropriateness of holding defence stocks is ""changing quite a bit."" His firm launched the VanEck Defense UCITS ETF in early 2023. It now has well over $2 billion in managed assets, after returning 44% in 2024 alone. So far this year, it's up 10%.""We've seen tremendous growth,"" he said in an interview. And flows into the fund in the first weeks of this year ""are even bigger than they were in 2024,"" he said. The fund draws between $20 million and $30 million of new money each day, he said.Bloomberg Economics calculates that protecting Ukraine and expanding their own militaries could cost Europe's major powers an additional $3.1 trillion over the next 10 years. That follows decades of underinvestment, according to a review of EU competitiveness published in September by former Italian Prime Minister and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi.Europe must make its defence industry more attractive to investors, the Draghi report said. That includes adapting the bloc's sustainable finance framework to support investments in the industry.European Union leaders are now discussing joint financing, and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is due to present a comprehensive plan next month that's set to include incentives for investors.ESG fund managers that add exposure to the defence sector face considerably better returns than they've been able to generate by holding traditional green stocks such as wind and solar.The S&P Global 1200 Aerospace & Defense Index rose 17% last year and is up 6% so far this year. The S&P Global Clean Energy Transition Index, meanwhile, is little changed this year, after losing 27% in 2024.Rheinmetall AG, which produces tanks and ammunition, is currently held in about 650 ESG funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lockheed Martin Corp., known for its fighter jets and missile systems, sits in roughly 370 ESG funds. BAE Systems Plc, which produces ammunition, missile launchers and Howitzers, is held in more than 450 ESG funds, the data show.Defence stocks have outperformed both other industrial stocks and the MSCI World Index, particularly in the past three years, said Kiran Aziz, head of responsible investments at Norwegian pension fund KLP.

HH Global's FY24 sustainability report is now live,"{'id': None, 'name': 'PR Newswire UK'}",https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/hh-globals-fy24-sustainability-report-is-now-live-302382459.html,"HH Global's FY24 sustainability report is now liveNews provided byHH Global21 Feb, 2025, 18:10 GMTShare this articleShare toXShare this articleShare toXLONDON,Feb. 21, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- HH Global's sixth annual sustainability report captures the breadth and impact of their environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives, underscoring how they continue to make meaningful contributions to people and the planet. These are the highlights from their financial year 2024 report.Net-zero plan finalized: 15 to zeroThe past 12 months marked a pivotal moment as HH Global finalized their ""15 to zero"" plan, aligning with the SBTi's (Science-Based Targets initiative) corporate net-zero standard. By focusing on 15 initiatives targeting five key emissions sources— energy, travel, sourcing, freight and waste—they are advancing towards a 50% reduction in Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2030 and a 90% reduction by 2040.These initiatives are anchored in measurable metrics and robust governance, ensuring progress is both transparent and impactful. HH Global acknowledges their total emissions – and particularly their scope 3 emissions – rose from FY23 to FY24. This was due to an increase in the purchase of higher carbon products that were manufactured in countries with a higher carbon energy supply. However, they remain steadfast in their commitment to reversing this trend and achieving its net-zero goals.Conscious Creative: setting the benchmark for responsible designHH Global's Conscious Creative program continues to redefine sustainable marketing, delivering innovation from ideation to production. Enhanced tools like carbon calculation and design scorecards have elevated its influence, impacting numerous projects across HH Global. Conscious Creative's recognition as a finalist at the World Sustainability Awards in the Eco-design category further cements their status as an industry leader in responsible design.Advancing the Sustainable Procurement FrameworkThe Sustainable Procurement Framework (SPF) remains a cornerstone of HH Global's ESG strategy, enabling their strategic supplier partners to enhance their environmental, social and governance credentials. To date, they have onboarded over 1,400 partners across 55 countries, accounting for$1.5B(73%) of their supplier spend.By leveraging technology and collaboration, SPF amplifies their impact by up to 10 times per supplier across their supply chain – making it a key driver for clients seeking a more sustainable future.Empowering women-owned businesses with WEConnectDiversity and inclusion remain central to HH Global's supplier strategy. Through their partnership with WEConnect International, they have engaged with women-owned businesses globally, introducing them to the benefits of certification. Their efforts have included outreach to supplier partners in LATAM, as well as the EMEA and APAC regions. This year, they attended and participated in their first WEConnect conference inIndia, reinforcing their dedication to supporting women entrepreneurs.A message from HH Global's CEO""Our FY24 report reflects both the scale and sustainability commitments and challenges inherent in achieving them. While we celebrate successes such as the finalization of our net-zero plan and the growing influence of Conscious Creative, we remain transparent about areas where improvement is needed.""""Sustainability is a journey, one that demands bold commitments, rigorous action and accountability. As we look ahead to 2025, we are inspired by the momentum we've built and the shared dedication of our teams, clients and partners to creating a more sustainable world.""Kristian Elgey, CEO, HH GlobalView HH Global's FY24 sustainability report on theirwebsite.Logo -https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/471140/hh_global_Logo.jpg×Modal title"

Anything to distract the public from the evidence of their criminality.Â  Violence and terrorism should be expected.Economic Downturn Is Inevitable â Trump Will Be BlamedBroad budget cuts are essential to saving the economy in the long term, but they are also a double-edged sword in the short term. For example, US GDP stats rely greatly on government spending in their calculations (they shouldnât, but they do). Government spending accounts for around 36% of our nationâs GDP â Itâs a methodology used in recent decades to make our economic health look stronger than it really is.As Trump executes extensive cuts to government spending, this will in turn make it look as if GDP is plummeting. Leftists will claim that Trumpâs policies are crashing the financial system.On top of this,ÂIâve been warning for some timeÂ that the Biden Administration has been engaging in complex data manipulation. Now that Biden is gone the real data is already coming out and itâs not good. Inflation numbers and employment numbers from the Biden era are being âadjustedâ, as I predicted, showing a much weaker economy than originally reported. Retail stats and GDP are next.The American public will need a crash-course in how the economy works and who is behind the downturn, or the leftist media will have a field day with the revised stats.Can The Investment World Handle The Truth?When the level of fraud within the US system is fully exposed, will the investment world panic? Will they pull their money out of US markets that have long been supported artificially by government funds and central bank intervention? These are valid questions we need to consider. The truth needs to come out regardless; nothing can be fixed until the source of the rot is uncovered. That said, the mantra âignorance is blissâ is one that America has been living by for a long time.I think Americans are desperate for the truth and desperate for reform, but change on the scale we are facing always brings chaos with it. I suggest that conservatives and patriots prepare accordingly.Cutting Ties With Globalist Run GovernmentsAs the process of transparency moves forward in the US we have to take into account that Europe, the UK, Australia and Canada are all still well under the hypnosis of the cabal. Things are changing overseas; the UK, Germany and France are starting to see conservative movements blossom, but globalists are determined to stop them from gaining political traction.I suspect we will see strained or broken ties with many former allies in the coming years as they crack down on their own citizens and show their true authoritarian colors. Weâre already seeing this happening in the UK, Germany, France and Romania among others.The Most Dangerous Time Is When You Think You Are WinningEstablishment elites are like vampires. In fact, I suspect the whole mythology of vampires from centuries ago is actually based on the very real and evil crimes of the elites of the past. They use their wealth and influence to gain a foothold in your country, city or village. They use subterfuge to gain trust and exert authority. They spread darkness and corruption like a cancer, then they feed on the population at will while pretending to be benevolent leaders.But these parasites must be invited in by the people. The public has to, in some ways, give consent to their own victimization. We have to willfully ignore their activities; our apathy is seen as consent. Sunlight is the primary remedy and the vampires flee when itâs unleashed. Finally, if all else fails a stake through the heart is required to end them. It could be a proverbial stake, or a very real one.Audits of the corrupt system are the sunlight. Independent patriot rebellion is the stake through the heart if all else fails.Just because the evil is exposed does not necessarily mean it will stop or disappear. Often these cornered creatures fight even harder and their mission is to take you down with them. Great truth often precedes the darkest of days and the collapse of epochs. As the shadow government faces uncertainty for perhaps the first time ever, who knows how the leviathan will react?Read more at:Alt-Market.us"

Cloud collaboration in app development: A brief overview,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Android Headlines'}",https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/02/cloud-collaboration-in-app-development-a-brief-overview.html,"Android Headlines/Android Apps/Cloud collaboration in app development: A brief overviewCloud collaboration in app development: A brief overviewByYackulic KhristopherFebruary 18, 2025Cloud-based collaboration has made it possible for development teams to work across multiple projects, share resources instantly, and maintain consistent workflows without traditional infrastructure limitations. A cloud workspace enables app developers to coordinate their efforts, manage code repositories, and deploy updates simultaneously, no matter where they are in the world.Now, looking at the numbers, the latest market size projection hammers home the massive shift toward cloud-based solutions. The currentglobal market size of cloud computingwas valued at $676.29 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach the $2,291.59 billion mark by 2032.If you are looking to understand how cloud collaboration can streamline the app development process, check out this guide to learn how teams are leveraging AI-driven workflows and enhancing security to work smarter and faster.How Cloud Collaboration Benefits App Developers?Cloud-based collaboration toolshelp bring together developers, designers, and project managers. Instead of passing files back and forth or dealing with version conflicts, teams can work together in real time, seeing changes as they happen.Here are the advantages of cloud collaboration for app developers:–Real-Time Collaboration Capabilities: Platforms in the cloud empower developers to work on the same code at the same time, facilitating feedback and task completion.–Enhanced Testing Capabilities: Cross-platform testing and deployment become more manageable as developers can access many testing environments and devices through the cloud.–Version Control Systems: Platforms in the cloud allow users with access to a file to revert to previous versions when needed.–Streamlined Project Management: Project management tools help you keep timelines on track by allowing users to assign tasks and monitor progress in real time.–Advanced Security Measures: Teams can protect code and intellectual property with security measures like encryption and advanced authentication methods.–Global Talent Access: Businesses can recruit developers across different time zones, benefiting from diverse perspectives and delivering faster project cycles.The Synergy of Cloud Collaboration and AIAI-powered cloud storage systems simplify collaboration by taking over repetitive, time-consuming tasks. For instance, smart cloud storage can route files to the right stakeholders based on content type, track approval status, and notify team members when action is needed.For hassle-free vendor onboarding, AI systems can extract key information from documents, validate data, and move files through preset approval chains.Why Opt for Collaborative Workspaces Powered by AI?AI-driven cloud storage platforms can classify unstructured data, including images, documents, and videos, without manual tagging. AI understands context, making file organization and retrieval a breeze. ABox-sponsored ESG white papershows that 72% of AI adopters realized value from their AI initiatives within three months, and 11% saw immediate value.A marketing image can be auto-tagged with relevant campaign details, or technical documents can be sorted by project phase or targeted audience.Cloud environments can also make cloud collaboration secure by using deep-learning malware detection mechanisms that spot unusual access patterns, identify potential data breaches, and alert security teams in real time.Redefining How App Development Teams Build TogetherCutting-edge cloudcollaboration toolsare helping developers break down the final barriers to remote collaboration. We hope that this fusion of technology will continue to reshape creative processes within the field. The future ofapp developmentis vast, deeply engaging, and fundamentally built on collaboration.Share this pagefacebooklinkedin2X_logo_2023_originalredditcomments_altlinkCopyright ©2025 Android Headlines.

New Thai ESG fund to be launched soon,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Bangkok Post'}",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/2964468/new-thai-esg-fund-to-be-launched-soon,"BusinessGeneralNew Thai ESG fund to be launched soonFinance ministry studying tax benefits for LTF holders who transfer units instead of sellingPUBLISHED : 20 Feb 2025 at 08:00NEWSPAPER SECTION:BusinessWRITER:Wichit ChantanusornsiriSmallMediumLarge2Listen to this articlePlayPauseThe new Thai ESG (environmental, social and governance) fund, which is being established to ease the selling pressure of long-term equity funds (LTFs) that have matured, is expected to be finalised in the first quarter of this year.Lavaron Sangsnit, permanent secretary to the Ministry of Finance, said that selling of maturing LTF units was among several factors currently affecting the Thai stock market, currently the worst performer in the world with a 10% loss since Jan 1.He said the ministry is considering a new Thai ESG fund to replace LTFs that have matured.Mr Lavaron said selling LTF units during a market downturn means the owners will receive a poor return and it will contribute to the bourse's decline.He said the ministry is evaluating how tax benefits could be structured for existing LTF holders who choose to transfer their investments to new Thai ESG funds instead of selling their units.LTFs had a five-year holding period requirement, meaning investors can sell their units without losing tax benefits after that period.LTF units worth 180 billion baht remain unsold, down from 240 billion at the end of last year, with average losses on the investments ranging from 5-10%.According to Mr Lavaron, in the past LTF purchases averaged between 25 billion and 30 billion baht per year. After the ministry did not extend tax benefits for LTFs, the tax-deductible Thai ESG funds were established, registering an annual purchase volume of roughly 27 billion baht last year.Thai ESG funds invest in Thai equities and debt securities that meet ESG criteria. Taxpayers can invest up to 30% of their annual income, capped at 300,000 baht, and must hold the investment for at least five years from the date of purchase.In a related development, Mr Lavaron said the ministry's 2025 goal of 3.5% economic growth is challenging, requiring action on multiple fronts, particularly acceleration of investment projects that were already approved by the Board of Investment (BoI), which remains feasible.According to BoI data, last year investment promotion applications totalled 3,137 projects, representing a 40.4% year-on-year increase, with a total investment value of 1.14 trillion baht, up 34.5%.The value of projects that received investment promotion certificates was 850 billion baht, a 72.5% increase.KEYWORDSInvestingLTFStock marketTax benefitsThai ESG fundDo you like the content of this article?COMMENT(2)"

Why The Third Generation Family CEO Of Bic Is Passing The Torch,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2025/02/24/why-the-third-generation-family-ceo-of-bic-is-passing-the-torch/,"LeadershipBETAThis is a BETA experience. opt-outherePremiumEditors' PickWhy The Third Generation Family CEO Of Bic Is Passing The TorchGonzalve Bich, Grandson Of Founder Marcel Bich, Transformed The Company’s Strategy, Built Revenue And Strengthened Its Purpose During His Seven Years At The TopByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff.I'm the writer for the Forbes C-Suite newsletter series.Follow AuthorFeb 24, 2025, 11:08am ESTUpdated Feb 25, 2025, 11:01am ESTSave ArticleThe grandson of Bic founder Marcel Bich and son of former CEO Bruno Bich, 46-year-old Gonzalve Bich is the third generation to serve as CEO of the iconic pen, razor and lighter company. But Gonzalve Bich didn’t get the job just because of his family ties. He spent more than 20 years serving in various positions across the company, working his way up to the CEO’s office. Once he got there, he led the company through several transitions to modernize its strategy and approach to the market, bringing the company to solid growth.In December, Gonzalve Bich announced he would step down as CEO by September 30. I talked to him about his career at the company, its transformation strategy, and what he’s doing next. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. It was excerpted in theForbes CEO newsletter.Bic is your family’s company, but how did you get started as an employee? What did your career journey look like?Bich:I was working in New York City as a management consultant at Deloitte and I had decided to leave the firm. My Dad was the CEO at the time. We were driving back from his place and he says to me, ‘Could you do me a favor? Could you go out to Singapore and solve a minor issue for me? You’ll be there three months.’ I was between jobs. It’s like, ‘Yeah, absolutely, Dad.’That was more than 20 years ago. I ended up going out there, and very quickly ended up being responsible for our Asian operations, fixing [the problems]. The better part of 14 years was spent going from business unit to business unit, essentially transforming. That’s how I was being deployed: We have a problem. Nobody wants to go tackle this one. Let’s send Gonzalve.It was really interesting. I learned a lot. The business units got bigger and bigger as we went along.Bic CEO Gonzalve Bich.BicI did a couple of functional assignments as well. I was our head of people development for a little bit over a year, which is fascinating. That role was: identify, train, retain and develop the top 250 of the organization at that point in time. What’s interesting about that is a lot of those people are still at Bic. That was in 2007. The young talent that I had identified then, many of them are continent directors, plant leaders or on my management team.Then I was the head of our innovation function for Shave, and that taught me a lot about the consumer. This is pre-2008, so you’re talking a world where you can’t do web scrapes. There is not a million Amazon reviews.I kept growing in the organization. I ran our northern European business, I was GM of our U.K. and Scandinavia business. That was really fascinating. You’re talking about very mature markets. I met my wife in London. We got married and then I ran our developing markets business, which was everything that wasn’t the U.S. and western Europe. That was tough, but a really good jumping off point for the most senior leadership: to understand what is a truly global business.Bic operates in every country of the world. We sell 30 million products a day all over the planet, but in very different ways. The positioning of the brand back then was very different. In some countries, we were positioned as a school supply business. In others, we were an office supply business. Some countries: very heavy Shave, nobody knew about the lighters. In other countries—the U.S.—the lighter is No. 1.I got through all those roles and ultimately was asked, ‘Would you like to be a candidate for CEO?’ My predecessor was non-family, a guy named Mario Guevara. He was CEO for about 10 years. It was me and some external candidates.I ultimately was successful and then took on the role of transforming the business. Just as I became CEO, our industries started declining. The legacy core businesses were hitting more and more challenges. The business was actually starting to decline between 0.5% to a little bit over 1% a year, and the EBIT margin was going down. It was a very challenging time for the business and required a total reset and a rethink.The best way I can summarize what we did was a phrase my dad coined: Honor the past, invent the future. This was an organization that was very heavy ‘honor the past,’ struggling to even envision a future that they wanted to create, much less execute against it. The last eight years have been about transforming the organization from a capability perspective, organization perspective, investment perspective. We’ve generated 5% annual growth over the period in industries that are [growing in] low single digits, if not in decline. Significant outperformance while also growing EBIT.Why did you decide to step down now?TheHorizon Planthat I launched, its natural ending point is the end of 2025. I had always wanted to have two chapters in my career, and this felt like the natural hopping off point. If I stayed and rewrote the next growth strategy that would’ve built on everything that we’ve done organizationally, as well as the acquisitions, that would’ve been another six-to-10 year commitment. I felt that at 46, I was in a really good position to transform and do something else. At 56, I might not have quite the same stomach or appetite for it.This felt like a natural point in time. I feel really good about where the business is. I feel totally confident in its capability to overcome quite significant challenges—take the last four or five years [of] the macro geopolitical environment. I look at my management team. It’s never been stronger. I’ve been here more than 20 years, I’ve seen quite a few management teams. This is a team that can take on those challenges.All those stars aligned and gave me the comfort to make that decision.Tell me about the Horizon Strategic Plan. What were the most important things, and how did you make it work?Prior to Horizon, there was a plan calledInvent the Future, and that was the reorg of the total business. This was a business that was designed for the lowest operating unit to be optimized, but it had no global strategy. In the 75 years prior to the launch of Horizon, we had actually never had a written strategy at Bic. It had always been: just keep growing—demographic growth, unit growth, brand, invest. But it wasn’t coordinated. So the first thing I did was transform how we worked.I could say that I had foresight and forethought, [but] I’m going to admit that I was probably lucky because this was just before March 2020. We went to a decentralized model, very technologically enabled. And when Covid hit us in mid-March 2020, we pivoted seamlessly. The additional benefit of our no-debt structure also meant I didn’t spend three months doing head sheds with my board and banks every day to recapitalize. We were able to go right through that. We never closed a factory unless it was mandated by a government, because our goods were qualified during the pandemic as essential. We were able to keep everybody employed and the units coming out to serve the markets.We launched the strategic work [at the] end of 2019, and we were going to launch Horizon in May 2020. We took it to our teams internally, and then to the market,in November 2020. Essentially, it was a re-imagining of our business. That came through the reframing of each of the businesses.Instead of thinking we’re a pen manufacturer, we’re a human expression company. We do coloring, we do tattoos, we do digital notebooks, we do everything that allows people to express themselves in a myriad of different ways. And that took the total adjustable market from less than $10 billion to north of $50 billion. It gave us not only an aspiration, but I can’t tell you how much ambition it drove and engagement within our employee base around the world. Even the guys in the factories were so excited: That opens up all sorts of possibilities of new products we can make, and new channels and new revenue streams.Same thing in our lighter business. We rebranded that one ‘Flame for Life’ and said, we’re not just here to sell pocket lighters in convenience stores and gas stations where you might buy cigarettes. We’re here to address all your usage needs: candles, incense, sports, outdoors, barbecues, cooking, what have you. We’ve grown that through new product introduction and a lot of geographic growth.Finally, something that was very different from our history. We took our Blade business, where we have all this amazing technology. In many countries that works with the Bic brand, but in some countries, it doesn’t. So we launched ourBic Blade Tech businessthat powers new, nascent and ambitious brands who want to make inroads into personal grooming with our technology, their brand, and their capital in markets that we’re not in. That’s done quite well.You have to know that Bic is a company that essentially has been built on acquisition. My grandfather didn’t invent the ballpoint pen. We acquired the patent. We didn’t invent the disposable lighter. We acquired a small company in Brittany, France that we transformed. And the Shave business was a company in Greece called Violex that we acquired. This is a company that has always acquired the cornerstone, then built around it and on top of it, on a solid base. I wanted to reconnect with that entrepreneurial acquisitive history.We did a number of acquisitions over the period, a couple of them just distribution. We did a deal in Kenya and another one in Nigeria because Africa for us is a very strong pillar of growth. We tripled business across the Middle East and Africa in a decade. Very significant market share leadership positions all across the continent.Then webought Djeep, which is a higher-end lighter. It allows us to have higher price points, more decoration. It’s a different premium offer to the consumer. Then we boughtInkboxandTattly, our two non-permanent tattoo assets, to start building out our skin creative portfolio.And finally at the end of last year, after 18 months of hard work identifying the company that we wanted, webought Tangle Teezer, which gets us into the haircare and grooming segment.Tangle Teezer seems to be taking Bic into something completely new. Is getting more into that segment the goal?Let me tell you how we screen opportunities. We look at brand. You’ve got to be No. 1 or No. 2, and we have to be able to build. The values and DNA of the brand have to be close to what we know how to do. Tangle Teezer is that. It’s a democratizing product under $20. Very broad based, but it’s high quality. It’s not the opening $3 hairbrush price point. It has technology.Two is channel. And the good news is Tangle Teezer, their sales right now are 50% online, 50% offline. But when they’re offline, it’s very close: It’s in the same aisle as our female shave category. These are customers we know.They’re supply chains that we already manage. It’s packaging formats, we understand and we can optimize. Then there’s the manufacturing technology. The way Tangle Teezer is manufactured is the exact same processes and many of the same raw materials that we use. So over time, we’re going to be able to improve, speed up, and improve margins to be able to reinvest in the brand. It’s actually really synergistic in our current business.Did you feel any specific pressure to succeed since this is essentially your family business? Did you feel like people are looking at you with more scrutiny?I don’t have anything to compare it to, so it’s impossible for me to really give you a perspective. Do you feel watched? Absolutely. Is the scrutiny quite intense? Yes, but I think that that’s actually really positive, because that scrutiny generally comes with higher levels of team member engagement. You can deliver good news in earnest, you can deliver tough news honestly and straightforwardly, which I think people always appreciate no matter what the situation.I was extremely close with the founder, my grandfather, and I’m not going to say that there was pressure because he passed away [when] I was only 14, so he and I never talked about it. My Dad and I talked about it a lot. He was CEO as well. And I do and did feel a sense of desire to carry on the torch. Now I feel that I’ve accomplished that, and I’m ready to pass on the pen.Is there anybody in the family that is up and coming in leadership, or is it likely that somebody who is outside of the family is going to be taking the helm?My predecessor was a non-family member, and my successor will most probably be a non-family member. We’re a very large family, but the age range is very broad. No one of my family’s on the leadership team. This will be an outside hire, but the family is extremely committed to its shareholdership in the company, the long-term success of the brand and of our team members.There’s three things [that have always driven me]. One is the creation of value, and that value comes in a lot of different ways. In more recent times, I think we’ve done a better job of talking about financial, but also extra-financial value, societal value, social value. I’m proud of five years of consecutive EBIT growth, five years of free cash flow growth, dividend at the highest that it’s been in a very long time. This is a company that’s healthy, with an extremely healthy balance sheet, that is capable of not only weathering crisis and storm, but also has the means and the desire to invest in its future.The second thing that’s always driven me is the creation of opportunity. I look at the way we operate our factories and our people development programs, and it’s a real source of pride. We help our employees in the plants get GEDs if they don’t have them, or technical certificates to be able to better themselves and create better value for their families, and in some cases their communities. We operate in India and Brazil and Nigeria. These are places where you’re actually supporting a much broader set of people than just that person [on your team] and their immediate family.The third thing, which is not specific to me, but something I really believe in, is showing that business can be a force for good. When I open the news on a daily basis, it’s hard to find positive things. I’ve got a lot of doom and gloom, and this is bad, and you should feel guilty about all these wonderful things. I wish that we spent even 10% of that time focusing on all the good that the business does. [In] 2018, we set out and we said: Big ambitious goal, [we] want to really make an impact. Let’simprove the learning conditionsof a quarter billion students on the planet. The original number was 25 million. I told the team, no, we’re going to do 250 million. We just broke through 210 [million]. We’re going to get to 250 [million] by the end of the year. As I walk out the door at the end of this year, I’ll be able to, with great pride, say I led the organization that improved the learning conditions of a quarter billion people on the planet. Hell yes. That’s business as a force for good.The things that we’ve done in ESG, they’re hard. They’re not super hard on the P&L, but you’ve got to make them work. These are forces that are at odds with each other. When we said that we were going to take our packaging commitment to100% sustainable packagingfrom a start below 25%, that was big, ambitious, and I’m not sure everybody believed we would get there. We’re there. We see that the end’s in sight.These are the things that I think that businesses should do a better job of telling their own teams about, because sometimes your own teams don’t even know what you’re doing. We’re very positive actors socially, in society. And when we’re not, we can strive for better.You are on the committee to help choose your successor. What are you looking for?You want someone who understands the long term. The family legacy is definitely there. While we will sit on the board as a family and represent, we also want somebody that has that balance of understanding: For the long term you have to have a short term. One of our values is sustainability, and it has many different forms. When we wrote that value into our code, it’s about having a sustainable business, and not leveraging tomorrow on today.Somebody who understands the power of a global brand. Bic is one of the most recognized brands on the planet. You interact with it daily. One of the coolest parts about this job is people have a Bic product more or less throughout their day in their hand. Not a ton of companies and brands can say that. You wake up in the morning, you shave, you’re holding your Bic shaver. You go to work, you’re holding your Bic pen. You come home, you light a candle, you’ve got a Bic. We’re really part of your day. You want somebody that understands that.Somebody that has the appetite and ambition for growth, because we have delivered over performance versus our markets in growth, and we definitely want to continue that. But it’s also a stewardship function of the brand, the business and the people. We take that extremely seriously. You’ve got to understand how to balance the risks short-term, long-term, make decisions. Hopefully we don’t have another Covid for this next person to manage through, but I want to feel comfortable that whoever I hand the keys to would make—I’m not going to say the right choice—but the same kind of choices I made during the pandemic: not terminating people, paying salaries on time, making sure that people were okay, focusing on family. Those are the things that make us successful over the long term.What are you going to do next?One of the things that I’m really excited about is launching my foundation. I have four children who I love tremendously, and one of them is autistic. There’s a lot of people doing amazing stuff on that, and I’m definitely in awe of what they bring to the children themselves. But in my parent journey, what I realized is in order to be successful, I believe you have to have a strong family foundation. What I want to do is empower and fund thought leaders, projects and programs in our communities that really focus on creating the stability of the home, not only for the child, but also for the siblings, also for the mental health of the parents. This foundation will spend all of its time and resources to create communities of support so that you have that foundational family bedrock on which everybody can grow up. That’s going to take up a bit of my time.After that, I’m going to look for opportunities to take all I’ve learned and all I’ve done to transform other businesses, grow other brands and work with other people somewhere globally.Bic has been a part of you for your entire life. What was the biggest thing you learned that was new when you became CEO?There’s a tremendous amount. That last step, even having been in the business for 15 years, very close to leadership, the reality, it does shift quite a bit. It’s humbling to become the CEO because ultimately you go from being the team member in a team of 15,000, to responsible for 15,000. That’s tremendously engaging, but humbling as well.The balance has to shift. The way you structure how you think about things. Notions of time, notions of risk, notions of return change when you become CEO. But ultimately, it’s about taking all the positive energy.I’m extremely grateful for all the years that I had with my team, and the high levels of business engagement and family engagement. You take all that energy and you turn it into what drives you every day, and you become pretty unstoppable.This story has been edited to correct an error in business improvement statistics.Send me a securetip.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades"

IAB Europe Releases Latest Annual State of Readiness Report,"{'id': None, 'name': 'ExchangeWire'}",https://www.exchangewire.com/blog/2025/02/19/iab-europe-releases-latest-annual-state-of-readiness-report/,"IAB Europe Releases Latest Annual State of Readiness ReportbyExchangeWire PressBoxon 19th Feb 2025 inNewsIAB Europe, the European-level industry association for the digital marketing and advertising ecosystem, today (February 19th, 2025) announced the results of its latest annual ‘State of Readiness - Sustainability in Digital Advertising’ Report for 2025. Now in its third year, the report provides key insights into the industry’s sustainability priorities, actions taken to reduce carbon footprints, and the progress made towards more sustainable practices across Europe.Based on 102 responses from companies in the digital advertising ecosystem across Europe, the report reveals that the majority of businesses (74%) see sustainability as a vital component of their business models. The number of companies that have set Science-Based Targets (SBTs) has also seen significant progress, increasing to 28% in 2025.The report also reveals the need for a multidimensional approach for continued progress in environmental sustainability. It emphasises the need for key actions, with respondents strongly agreeing/agreeing that greenhouse gas (GHG) estimation, the creation of consistent standards for GHG estimation, and the development and adoption of tools to reduce emissions are needed, to drive meaningful change.Key findings from the 2025 State of Readiness Report highlight:Sustainability is still a priority:Sustainability is still a key challenge for the digital advertising industry in 2025 being cited as the second most important challenge, just after measurement.Focus on emissions and DE&I growth:GHG emissions remain the top Environmental, Sustainability, and Governance (ESG) concern, while an emphasis on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) has grown significantly.Progress in emissions measurement:Almost half of businesses now estimate the emissions produced by digital media products, doubling from 2024.Ongoing barriers to progress:Lack of industry standards and education remain key obstacles to progress on sustainability, though fewer companies cite financial constraints, indicating increased investment in sustainability efforts.Commenting on the findings, Townsend Feehan CEO of IAB Europe said ""The 2025 findings show encouraging progress, with more companies setting science-based targets and actively measuring their environmental impact. However, our industry still requires greater collaboration, consistent standards, and continued investment to drive meaningful change. IAB Europe remains committed to supporting the industry in accelerating its sustainability journey.”Anthony Falco, global director at Ad Net Zero also commented, “It’s clear that standardisation of GHG emissions measurement is required to accelerate reductions across the digital advertising landscape, and the development of Global Media Sustainability Framework(GMSF) is an important part of this. As more companies prioritise sustainability, in part to comply with regulatory requirements, standardisation can help create real, positive change for the industry.”IAB Europe’sSustainability Standards Committeeis a multi-stakeholder group that shares insights and delivers outputs that help reduce the amount of energy consumed and emissions produced by digital advertising. The findings from this year’s report will help drive the committee’s work for the year ahead.For more information about IAB Europe’s sustainability initiatives, visit the IAB Europe Sustainability Hubhere.

Maybank picks LTF transfer winners,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Bangkok Post'}",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/investment/2964358/maybank-picks-ltf-transfer-winners,"BusinessInvestmentMaybank picks LTF transfer winnersPUBLISHED : 20 Feb 2025 at 04:18NEWSPAPER SECTION:BusinessWRITER:Nuntawun PolkuamdeeSmallMediumLargeListen to this articlePlayPause(Photo: 123RF)Nine stocks are expected to benefit the most from the Finance Ministry's policy to transfer investments from matured long-term equity funds (LTFs) to Thai ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds, with progress on the transfer expected later this month, says Maybank Securities (Thailand).The ministry is studying a framework to transfer LTF investments to Thai ESG funds, including potential tax benefits and adjustments to the fund investment policy, which is expected to allocate a higher proportion to Thai equities.The brokerage expects the transition of investments from LTFs to Thai ESG funds should benefit two main categories of stocks. The first group will be reweighted as Thai ESG funds compared with their weighting in LTFs, including Bangkok Dusit Medical Services (BDMS), Siam Cement (SCC), True Corporation (TRUE), Praram 9 Hospital (PR9), and Intouch Holdings (INTUCH).The other group includes stocks held exclusively in Thai ESG funds, but not in LTFs, which should receive fresh capital when the transition occurs. These include Jaymart Group Holdings (JMART), North East Rubber (NER), Absolute Clean Energy (ACE), and Triple I Logistics (III).Maybank anticipates the holding period for the new Thai ESG fund will be five years.The Federation of Thai Capital Market Organizations urged the government to consider reinstating LTFs, with tax benefits similar to those in the past.""This proposal received positive signals from the Finance Ministry. The transition to Thai ESG funds should be clearer in the first half of 2025, and could be implemented within that period, potentially easing selling pressure from LTF redemptions,"" the brokerage noted.""The sooner the policy details are finalised, and the more attractive the tax incentives, the more significant the reduction in LTF selling pressure.""According to Maybank, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is dealing with external negative factors such as the US-China trade war, geopolitical tensions, and the Federal Reserve's slow pace of interest rate cuts.Domestic concerns include weak confidence in Thailand's economic growth, declining earnings of large-cap stocks, and company-specific issues affecting certain major firms.The last of the LTFs reached maturity this year, leading to a mass sell-off, with around 188 billion baht still left for redemption.""The Thai index decline has been driven by institutional investors redeeming their LTF units as investors are allowed to fully redeem them this year,"" according to Maybank.In January alone, LTF net outflows nearly totalled 20 billion baht, exerting pressure on the SET index, which has already dropped 10.2% year-to-date as of Feb 18.If redemption patterns follow those of the past three years, where January accounts for 29% of total annual LTF redemptions, the total LTF sell-off this year could reach a record high of 60 billion baht, up 77% from the previous year.""Without additional policy measures, LTF redemptions will remain a risk factor for the Thai stock market this year,"" noted Maybank, adding that reviving the LTF scheme could help reduce selling pressure for at least five years.KEYWORDSLong-term equity fundsLTFsDo you like the content of this article?COMMENT"

I hope he will continue to teach forever so that many more students can experience how wonderful and transformative it is to learn from such a talented teacher who is also absolutely a ray of sunshine in human form!”Credits:Photo: Cathy RoeslerPrevious imageNext imageThe following is part of a series of short interviews from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) featuring a student describing themselves and life at MIT. Today’s interviewee, Titus Roesler, is a senior majoring in electrical science and engineering. As a first-year at MIT, Roesler joined theExperimental Study Group(ESG), a learning community that offers new MIT students the general Institute requirements (GIRs) in a small, tight-knit class setting. Roesler stuck around as an associate advisor in subsequent years for new cohorts of first-year ESG students, as a teaching assistant for classes on calculus and group theory, and as an instructor for special seminars in electrical engineering that he designed from scratch and then taught. Roesler’s commitment to his academic community also goes deep. Besides his teaching work, for which he was recently honored with the EECS Undergraduate Teaching Award, he is a member of theUndergraduate Student Advisory Group in EECS(USAGE), which provides student feedback to the department.Q:Tell us about one teacher from your past who had an influence on the person you’ve become.A:While a student in ESG, I took ES.1801 (Single-Variable Calculus), ES.1802 (Multivariable Calculus), and ES.1803 (Differential Equations), all withGabrielle Stoy. One morning in late spring, Gabrielle asked me to stick around after class to speak with her. (I wondered which course policy I had violated, and worried throughout the lecture.) Instead, Gabrielle asked me if I would apply to be a teaching assistant for an ESG math class the next semester. I was ecstatic — and thus began my “teaching career” at MIT! Gabrielle formally retired from teaching mathematics in ESG in 2024, but we teamed up again to offer a special seminar on group theory over IAP [Independent Activities Period] 2025.Q:What is one conversation that changed the trajectory of your life?A:I’m grateful for all the conversations I’ve had withProf. Denny Freeman. I appreciate his kindness, wisdom, and willingness to find time to discuss career plans, research, and education with me. I’ve always left his office feeling more ambitious and optimistic than I did when I walked in.Q:Do you have a bucket list? If so, share one or two of the items on it.A:Running the Boston Marathon was on my bucket list for a few years, and I checked that off in 2024. Beyond that, I would love to explore Antarctica — perhaps by living and working at a research station for a year.Q:What’s your favorite key on a standard computer keyboard, and why?A:The backslash ( \ ) key is my favorite. I use it often forTEX commandswhen typesetting.Q:If you suddenly won the lottery, what would you spend some of the money on?A:A bulk order ofHagoromo chalk— the so-called “Rolls-Royce of chalk!”Q:If you had to teach a really in-depth class about a niche topic, what would you pick?A:In the context of signal processing, filters sift out desired frequency bands while attenuating others. I’d be interested in teaching a class on the theory and practice behind filter design — constructing a filter that satisfies a set of specifications. For example, analog or digital? Finite impulse response or infinite impulse response? Group delay? Causality? Stability? Practical implementation? I’m not an expert in filter design myself, but I’d appreciate the opportunity to consolidate what I’ve learned so far and study the topic in greater depth.Sharethis news article on:XFacebookLinkedInRedditPrintRelated LinksExperimental Study GroupUndergraduate Student Advisory Group (USAGE) in EECSDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceSchool of EngineeringRelated TopicsInterviewStudentsUndergraduateSTEM educationEducation, teaching, academicsElectrical engineering and computer science (EECS)School of EngineeringMIT Schwarzman College of ComputingRelated ArticlesStudent spotlight: Victory Yinka-BanjoPrevious itemNext item"

According to the Economic Survey of India 2024, the nation's equity market capitalization achieved a milestone of Rs 415 lakh crore (USD 5 trillion) last year, solidifying its position as the fifth-largest equity market globally.This growth, however, has often been accompanied by a short-term investor focus, driven by quarterly earnings and market pressures. This myopic view, while understandable, can hinder long-term value creation for companies and investors alike. With the markets now showcasing lingering volatility, near-term investments must be treaded cautiously.Investment horizons generally consider short-term range spanning from several weeks to a maximum of three years, encompassing asset classes like cash equivalents, bonds, and fixed-income instruments. Traditional financial metrics, such as quarterlyearnings per share(EPS) and return on equity (ROE), while valuable, can be misleading when used in isolation. They often incentivize short-term behaviors like cost-cutting, revenue manipulation, and excessive risk-taking to inflate short-term results, potentially jeopardizing long-term sustainability.Furthermore, an overemphasis on short-term metrics can discourage investment in research and development (R&D), innovation, and long-term growth initiatives. These investments, while crucial for long-term competitive advantage, may not always yield immediate returns, leading companies to forgo them in favor of short-term gains.Aligning Metrics with Long-Term Value CreationStock TradingMaximise Returns by Investing in the Right CompaniesBy - The Economic Times, Get Certified By India's Top Business News BrandView ProgramStock TradingRenko Chart Patterns Made EasyBy - Kaushik Akiwatkar, Derivative Trader and InvestorView ProgramStock TradingCandlesticks Made Easy: Candlestick Pattern CourseBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView ProgramStock TradingDow Theory Made EasyBy - Vishal Mehta, Independent Systematic TraderView ProgramStock TradingMarket 101: An Insight into Trendlines and MomentumBy - Rohit Srivastava, Founder- Indiacharts.comView ProgramStock TradingMarkets 102: Mastering Sentiment Indicators for Swing and Positional TradingBy - Rohit Srivastava, Founder- Indiacharts.comView ProgramStock TradingMarket 103: Mastering Trends with RMI and Techno-Funda InsightsBy - Rohit Srivastava, Founder- Indiacharts.comView ProgramStock TradingMarket 104: Options Trading: Kickstart Your F&O AdventureBy - Saketh R, Founder- QuickAlpha, Full Time Options TraderView ProgramStock TradingROC Made Easy: Master Course for ROC Stock IndicatorBy - Souradeep Dey, Equity and Commodity Trader, TrainerView ProgramStock TradingRSI Made Easy: RSI Trading CourseBy - Souradeep Dey, Equity and Commodity Trader, TrainerView ProgramStock TradingTechnical Analysis for Everyone - Technical Analysis CourseBy - Abhijit Paul, Technical Research Head, Fund Manager- ICICI SecuritiesView ProgramStock TradingIntroduction to Technical Analysis & Candlestick TheoryBy - Dinesh Nagpal, Full Time Trader, Ichimoku & Trading Psychology ExpertView ProgramStock TradingOptions Trading Course For BeginnersBy - Chetan Panchamia, Options TraderView ProgramStock TradingOptions Scalping Made EasyBy - Sivakumar Jayachandran, Ace ScalperView ProgramStock TradingFutures Trading Made Easy: Future & Options Trading CourseBy - Anirudh Saraf, Founder- Saraf A & Associates, Chartered AccountantView ProgramTo develop a more sustainable and long-term oriented capital market, a shift in focus is necessary. Companies should embrace frameworks that align with long-term value creation, such as:Purposeful capitalism:Investment firms are increasingly prioritizing client-centric approaches and fostering organizational cultures that emphasize ethical conduct, professionalism, sustainability and a defined sense of purpose within their business models, as mentioned in a recentstudyby CFA Institute. Also integrating ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) into business strategies and reporting can help companies identify and address long-term risks and opportunities, while also enhancing stakeholder trust.Integrated Reporting:This framework provides a holistic view of a company's performance by integrating financial, environmental, social, and governance information. In India, SEBI has mandated the top listed companies to file disclosures including integrated filing and BRSR (Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting), to enhanceESG reportingwithin the Indian corporate landscape and facilitate conversations amongst investors, companies and policymakers to ensure sustainable value creation in the market.Forward-Looking Metrics:Metrics such as customer lifetime value, employee engagement, innovation pipeline and sustainability aspects, can provide valuable insights into a company's long-term prospects.Aligning Investor ExpectationsAligning investor expectations with the time horizons of corporate strategies is crucial. This requires open and transparent communication between companies and investors. Issuers and investors should prioritize their interactions by focusing on long-term strategic objectives and clearly defined key performance indicators (KPIs) that measure progress towards achieving those goals and driving long term value creation.Furthermore, investors need to adopt a longer-term investment horizon and recognize the value of investing in companies that prioritize long-term sustainability. This shift in perspective will encourage companies to focus on long-term value creation rather than short-term gains.Best Practices for Evaluating Long-Term InvestmentsA common concern expressed by investors, policymakers, and corporate entities is that financial markets exhibit an excessive short-term focus, hindering companies' ability to cultivate sustainable long-term growth strategies. Evaluating long-term investments necessitates a nuanced and disciplined approach that transcends traditional financial metrics. This evaluation should encompass qualitative factors such as assessing a company's competitive advantage, management quality, and corporate governance. Furthermore, conducting scenario analyses can help assess the potential impact of various future events on a company's performance. Finally, a robust risk management framework is essential to identify and mitigate potential threats to long-term value creation.According to data released by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi),Systematic Investment Plan(SIP) inflows exhibited consistent growth last year, increasing from Rs 17,610 crore in December 2023 to Rs 25,320 crore in November 2024. Furthermore, the sectoral fund performance growth within the technology, pharma, renewable energy and healthcare sectors, as per recentreports, indicates a keen investor interest in alternative thematic funds, further fueled by the rise of green and ethical investing.The consistent growth in SIP inflows, strongly suggests sustained investor trust in mutual funds as an effective means for wealth accumulation, especially in the current market scenario marked by volatility. The Indian capital market has the potential to play a vital role in driving economic growth and development, and by shifting the focus from short-term gains to long-term value creation, we can foster a more sustainable and resilient market that benefits all stakeholders. This requires a collaborative effort from companies, investors, regulators, and policymakers to embrace a long-term perspective and adopt best practices for evaluating and rewarding long-term investments.(The author isDirector, Capital Markets Policy, India, CFA Institute)(You can now subscribe to ourETMarkets WhatsApp channel)(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

Photo / Alex BurtonNational and Act to consider whether to support NZ First's proposed crackdown on de-banking. Photo / Alex BurtonNeitherNationalnorActare throwing their support behind aNew Zealand FirstMember ofParliament’s bill aimed at stoppingbanksfrom withdrawing services from customers for“woke” reasons – yet, at least.Both parties will look into the specifics ofAndy Foster’s Members’ Bill, drawn from the ballot on Thursday, before backing it.The bill seeks to fine financial institutions that withdraw or refuse to provide customers with financial services for reasons that aren’t “commercial”.It specifically tries to stop banks from ditching customers that don’t meet their environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies.NZ First has taken issue with some banks curtailing lending to businesses legally involved in fossil fuels, if not seeking to close their accounts.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The party’s position potentially clashes with the view,supported by the courts, that banks can choose who they do business with.National MP and Commerce and Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Andrew Bayly said: “As with all Members’ Bills, the National caucus will consider the bill and determine a party position on it.“It’s also worth noting that there’s an ongoing select committee inquiry looking into whether banks are operating in the interests of Kiwis.”AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Meanwhile, Act MP Mark Cameron said: “When I first raised the problem of climate ideology in banking, it was an issue only grumbled about across the farm fence. Now it’s a mainstream concern, challenged in New Zealand’s highest chambers of power.“The Act team will be looking at the detail of this bill before forming a position.“In the meantime, Act will continue to make the case for tackling woke banking practices at the cause. That includes the Net Zero Banking Alliance, which major banks in the United States, Canada and Australia are rightly fleeing.“We’ve also challenged the stupid climate commitments placed on banks by the Financial Markets Authority.”Foster’s bill would need the support of the majority of Parliament to be passed into law.Specifically, it amends the Financial Markets (Conduct of Institutions) Amendment Act 2022 “to place a new duty on financial institutions to provide financial services to customers except in situations based on law or for valid and verifiable commercial grounds”.Banks have different policies aimed at limiting their exposures to emissions-intensive industries, but the extent to which “dirty” businesses, or those in sunset industries, are struggling to access banking services is unknown.Banks typically make the case a business’ exposure to climate change, or their carbon emissions profile, might be one of a range of factors they consider when they weigh up that business’ credit risk. ESG issues may also dovetail into credit risk.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.However, NZ First leader Winston Peters believed ESG standards were perpetuating “woke ideology”, which was “driven by unelected, globalist, climate radicals” in the banking sector.Finance Minister Nicola Willis suggested Parliament’s Finance and Expenditure Committee was well-placed to look into de-banking as a part of its inquiry into banking sector competition.Last week, the committeeresponded, saying it would call the chief executives of ANZ, ASB, BNZ and Westpac back before the committee to answer follow-up questions on a range of issues, possibly including de-banking.Asked to explain its position on ESG and de-banking, the BNZ said in a statement: “Business lending is determined on a case-by-case basis.“Decisions are risk-based and a range of factors are considered, for example, the type of business, balance-sheet strength, geographic location, long-term sustainability of the business and our market exposure.”Meanwhile, Westpac said: “Westpac NZ has independently set emissions intensity 2030 targets for the most emissions-intensive sectors in our lending portfolio, but these are set at a sector portfolio level, rather than at an individual customer level.“The intention of setting these targets is to engage with our customers on their transition plans and ensure we are continuing to support them for years to come.“In 2019, Westpac NZ ceased lending to coal mining due to a combination of credit risks, large financial losses and ESG risks.“We also undertake individual customer and ESG risk assessments as part of our standard credit process. We do this to fully understand the risks to the customer, the bank and ultimately our depositors who fund our lending.”Jenée Tibshraeny is theHerald’s Wellington business editor, based in the Parliamentary Press Gallery.

Private insurers saw a surge in retail sum assured by 41% YoY in 9M FY2025 (30% in FY2024), higher than the retail NBP growth of 17% (7% in FY2024). Given the shift in product mix from high value of new business (VNB) margin non-participating (non-par) products to low VNB margin unit-linked investment plan (ULIP) products, the pressure on the VNB margins is likely to continue, resulting in increased sum assured and rider attachments in a bid to offset the negative impact of the product shift. As the capital requirements for life insurers are also a function of the sum assured in force, with higher growth in sum assured, the capital intensity for incremental growth is expected to remain high, resulting in elevated incremental capital requirements for the sector. The recently proposed increase in the foreign direct investment (FDI) limits to 100% could boost the inflow of capital to the sector and reduce the protection gap in India.While historically, the growth in life insurance premiums has been driven by investment considerations, with increased consumer awareness, the industry has seen an uptick in demand for the coverage of mortality risks. While the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) continues to dominate the market with a substantial share in retail and group NBP, however, private insurers lead in terms of sum assured. With a market share of 84% in terms of retail sum assured and 80% in terms of group sum assured in 9M FY2025, private players have a relatively higher share when compared to their market share of 63% and 28% in terms of retail NBP and group NBP, respectively.Neha Parikh, Vice President & Sector Head – Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA said: “Mortality protection demands significant upfront capital, risk management and reinsurance tie-ups, resulting in concentration of the sum assured market. Within the retail and group sum assured, capital requirement is even higher in the retail segment, given that the risk is underwritten for a much longer tenor. Some large private insurers benefit from their long operating history, resulting in backbook surplus[1], hence, partly supporting their ability to underwrite a higher sum assured”.With higher growth in sum assured compared to the NBP segment, the market share in sum assured outstanding at the end of December 2024 is much higher at 65% (45% in FY2018) in the retail segment for the top five private insurers. Given the capital requirements, the market for sum assured is likely to remain skewed towards the insurers who have high backbook surplus or can bring in a larger pool of capital. To augment their capital base, the large private insurers have raised sub-debt of Rs. 29.5 billion (additional sub-debt of Rs. 23.0 billion expected by Mar-2025) and equity of Rs. 19.1 billion in YTDFY2025 compared to the overall sub-debt of Rs. 43.7 billion raised in the previous four years.“The high capital intensity of the life insurance sector necessitates substantial investments to sustain growth. The increase in FDI limits will provide the much-needed capital boost to the sector, enabling insurers to expand their mortality coverage and increasing penetration,” Parikh added.The shift towards ULIPs from the non-participating segment from FY2024 onwards has been driven by the changes in the taxation regime for high ticket non-par policies, buoyancy in equity capital markets and decline in yields on Government securities, thereby lowering the returns on non-par policies. Apart from the need to protect the VNB margins, the growth in sum assured over the years has also been supported by the increase in ticket sizes with the retail sum assured per policy for private insurers rising to Rs. 2.4 million in FY2024 from Rs. 1.3 million in FY2018.For LIC, however, the retail sum assured per policy has remained stable (Rs. 0.3 million) and is much lower compared to the private insurers. Group sum assured also saw significant growth with the growth in credit life, driven by robust credit expansion in the retail segment (CAGR of 18% in FY2021-FY2024), especially unsecured loans (CAGR of 21%), where the penetration of credit life remains higher.February 20, 2025 07:11Share market live today: Abans Financial Services advises Vaishali Pharma on strategic acquisition of Kesar PharmaVaishali Pharma announced its acquisition of a majority stake in Kesar Pharma Limited.

And Mercedes-Benz’s profits dropped by 54%.German carmakers are in trouble. Their business model was based on two things: cheap Russian energy powering the German engineering coupled with sales in China subsidizing antiquated, overblown unions protecting their cost structure at home. The first pillar collapsed and the second is now under severe pressure.China now builds its own decent cars. There’s no need for the Chinese to buy anything other than Chinese cars which accelerates capital flight.Now, let me show you something else. The flow of trade, of course, is seen in the currency markets.What you’re looking at above isn’t so much the dollar gaining as much as it is the euro losing. Capital is fleeing Euroland — exactly as we’ve been promising you it would.Wanna see something else cool?Now, you may look at this and think,“Aha, Chris… look, it’s the cheapest it’s been in over 30 years.”But I think Europe is a value trap. Unfortunately, this is not purely business cycle cyclical. This is terminal. I loved Europe. I lived there for years and traveled around it extensively, so believe me I find no pleasure in my diagnosis, but Europe is completely and totally au-pha-cdup, and I don’t see it getting much better anytime soon.The other component of this is the US markets, because western capital has always played largely between Europe and North America. So if it’s not Europe, well…And it’s fueling this.There are many reasons for the US stock market to outperform. Certainly, the collapse of Europe is a major factor in this. Capital flight is one reason I’d be very reluctant to short US stocks, despite their relative and absolute overvaluation.As Energy Goes, So Goes the EconomySolar Firm Collapse Shakes Denmark’s Financial SystemThe collapse of Denmark’s Better Energy A/S, a once-hyped solar park developer, is sending repercussions through the Nordic country’s financial system and bringing eerie reminders of the recent problems for another green energy champion, Northvolt AB, in neighboring Sweden.It was inevitable that the renewable energy scam would finally be exposed. What is worth looking at, though, is the extent of carnage left in the wake of the woke virtue signaling crowd. I have long taken aim at the cowards running large pools of capital. They take home their big paychecks and kowtow to the rainbow people with diversity hires and pronoun nonsense while taking the hard-earned and entrusted capital from average folks and ploughing it into isht that never made any sense. And they did it because they’re professional weasels!Among those burnt are Sydbank A/S, Denmark’s third-largest listed lender, which cut its 2024 financial outlook on Thursday and said Better Energy’s collapse could lead to 450 million kroner ($63 million) in impairment charges. Sydbank shares tanked as much as 8% in Copenhagen, the biggest one-day drop since March.Denmark’s biggest pension fund, ATP, which owns about 15% of Better Energy, will lose a three digit million-krone amount, a company spokesperson told Bloomberg. ATP invested 696 million kroner in 2022, Better Energy’s earnings report for that year shows. ATP said earlier this week it’s taking a major hit on its 2.3 billion-krone stake in troubled battery maker Northvolt, in which the Danish pension fund was one of the largest owners with a stake of about 5%.It is one thing losing your own money and risking it in some new fad. These muppets running the pension fund should be immediately fired and ridiculed. But you know what? They won’t! They will keep their cushy jobs and pensioners will simply get hosed.It’s a very disappointing situation,” ATP’s head of Danish equities, Claus Wiinblad, said in emailed comments. “Better Energy has found itself in a situation where the shareholders’ money can’t be saved.No, it’s not “disappointing,” you moron. Capital flight is and always was entirely predictable. If you’d pulled your rainbow coloured head out of your ass, spent more time on the business and financials and less on your absurd ESG ratings, you wouldn’t be in this situation and — more importantly — your clients wouldn’t be facing steep losses.Sticking with energy and tying in the climate change scam…NY at the Pointy End of the Climate CatastrophistsThe pointy shoes are getting more and more desperate.New York state will fine fossil fuel companies a total of $75 billion over the next 25 years to pay for damage caused to the climate under a bill Governor Kathy Hochul signed into law on Thursday.You know what’s going to happen, right? Capital will simply leave New York, and the local government will seek to fill the collapsing revenue gap with higher taxes, which itself will see more folks with the ability to leave and the already dangerous and dirty New York will get worse due to capital flight.Imposing Ideology Brings ConflictCase in point…Qatar has threatened to stop vital gas shipments to the EU if member states strictly enforce new legislation that will penalise companies which fail to meet set criteria on carbon emissions, human and labour rights. Qatari energy minister Saad al-Kaabi told the Financial Times that if any EU state imposed non-compliance penalties on a scale referenced in the corporate due diligence directive Doha would stop exporting its liquefied natural gas to the bloc.This legislature is bad for the EU, but they’re already screwed… which is why they now import most of their energy (because it is impossible to do business within the EU). What this legislature basically does is it says that all EU-based companies (already a given) and ALL foreign (non-EU based) companies (such as Qatar) doing business with the EU must adhere to EU rules in all global operations or they will be fined up to 5% of their total global revenues.Companies must adopt and put into effect a transition plan for climate change mitigation aligned with the Paris Agreement and the 2050 climate neutrality objective, including intermediate targets under the European Climate Law.Qatar will simply prioritise doing business with the global south, and Europe will be left without energy.Editor’s Note: The Western system is undergoing substantial changes, and the signs of moral decay, corruption, and increasing debt are impossible to ignore. With the Great Reset in motion, the United Nations, World Economic Forum, IMF, WHO, World Bank, and Davos man are all promoting a unified agenda that will affect us all.To get ahead of the chaos, download our free PDF report “Clash of the Systems: Thoughts on Investing at a Unique Point in Time” byclicking here."

Ropes & Gray Discusses New SEC Guidance on ESG Engagement and Schedule 13D Filings,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Columbia.edu'}",https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/02/24/ropes-gray-discusses-new-sec-guidance-on-esg-engagement-and-schedule-13d-filings/,"Ropes & Gray Discusses New SEC Guidance on ESG Engagement and Schedule 13D FilingsByMarc RotterFebruary 24, 2025byeorozcoCommentThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff recently updated its guidance on circumstances in which investors engaging with issuers on ESG and other matters can file a short-form Schedule 13G as a passive or institutional investor rather than a long-form Schedule 13D.The updates are in the form of a significant revision to Question 103.11 and the publication of a new Question 103.12 of the SEC’s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations on Section 13(d) and Section 13(g) of the Exchange Act, which are availablehere.The prior guidance allowed investors engaging on ESG topics to often file a Schedule 13G rather than a Schedule 13D. The prior guidance stated that:“Generally, engagement with an issuer’s management on executive compensation and social or public interest issues (such as environmental policies), without more, would not preclude a shareholder from filing on Schedule 13G so long as such engagement is not undertaken with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing control of the issuer and the shareholder is otherwise eligible to file on Schedule 13G …” and“Engagement on corporate governance topics, such as removal of staggered boards, majority voting standards in director elections, and elimination of poison pill plans, without more, generally would not disqualify an otherwise eligible shareholder from filing on Schedule 13G if the discussion is being undertaken by the shareholder as part of a broad effort to promote its view of good corporate governance practices for all of its portfolio companies, rather than to facilitate a specific change in control in a particular company.”The new guidance takes a different approach.  It provides that:“Generally, a shareholder who discusses with management its views on a particular topic and how its views may inform its voting decisions, without more, would not be disqualified from reporting on a Schedule 13G. A shareholder who goes beyond such a discussion, however, and exerts pressure on management to implement specific measures or changes to a policy may be “influencing” control over the issuer. For example, Schedule 13G may be unavailable to a shareholder who:Recommends that the issuer remove its staggered board, switch to a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections, eliminate its poison pill plan, change its executive compensation practices, or undertake specific actions on a social, environmental, or political policy and, as a means of pressuring the issuer to adopt the recommendation, explicitly or implicitly conditions its support of one or more of the issuer’s director nominees at the next director election on the issuer’s adoption of its recommendation; orDiscusses with management its voting policy on a particular topic and how the issuer fails to meet the shareholder’s expectations on such topic, and, to apply pressure on management, states or implies during any such discussions that it will not support one or more of the issuer’s director nominees at the next director election unless management makes changes to align with the shareholder’s expectations.”Investors will need to closely consider this new guidance in determining whether and when engagement with issuers requires filing on a Schedule 13D rather than a Schedule 13G.This post comes to us from Ropes & Gray LLP. It is based on the firm’s memorandum, “SEC Staff Publishes New Guidance on When Shareholder Engagement on ESG and Other Matters Requires Schedule 13D Filings,” dated February 11, 2025, and availablehere."

Five Reasons Why ESG And Wokeism Are Taking A Beating,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rajeevpeshawaria/2025/03/04/five-reasons-why-esg-and-wokeism-are-taking-a-beating/,"LeadershipLeadership Strategy5 Reasons Why ESG Is Taking a BeatingByRajeev Peshawaria, Contributor.CEO, Stewardship Asia Centre. President, Leadership Energy Consulting.Follow AuthorMar 04, 2025, 03:36am ESTSave ArticleCommentCompanies can use steward leadership to advance their goals.Getty ImagesWere environmental social governance, diversity equity inclusion, and sustainability fads that have since died? It certainly feels like it in some circles, doesn’t it? I don’t believe they are dead at all. But the question is, why the current disenchantment with something we desperately need for saving ourselves and our only home?My simple assertion, one we’ve been making for a long time now, is that we were trying to solve existential environmental and social challenges unnaturally.1. We were asking consumers to consume less.Consumption is a basic human aspiration.Except for a few evolved souls, it is naive to expect ordinary humans to consume less. Interestingly, economies built on excessive consumption — that caused the problems in the first place — were lecturing the developing world to consume less.2. We were asking businesses to sacrifice some profit for purpose.Humans aren’t indiscriminately altruistic, yet we condemned self-interest and demonized profit.3. We were forcing behavior change through regulation.We tried to beat businesses into behaving responsibly even while we’ve always known that genuine behavior change comes from within. At best, regulation reduces bad behavior, it does not encourage good behavior. Doing no wrong is not the same thing as doing good.4. We were using incentives and cheaper capital to channel inclusive prosperity.The Principle of Least Effort tells us that humans always choose the easiest option to get what they want, in this case, profit. What the world needs is innovation to maximize greater good. So, rather than drive the innovation required to produce goods and services that solve environmental and social challenges, we largely ended up creating financial instruments that many took advantage of and profited from.5. We thought mandating measurement and reporting would do the trick.Management researchers and behavioral economists have regularly warned against the overuse of measurement and reporting, yet we have done exactly that. It is no surprise that the result was attempts to game the system through massive greenwashing, box-checking, and window dressing rather than meaningful action. Metrics and reports seem to have become the end in themselves rather than means to an end.MORE FOR YOUCourt Lets Trump Fire Watchdog Chief For Now: Here’s Where Trump And Musk Are Winning—And Losing—In Court‘Hamilton’ Cancels Kennedy Center Show Run In Protest Of Trump’s ‘Purge’Apple Takes No Risks With New M4 MacBook AirThese unnatural tools and measures were going against basic human instinct, hence the backlash. What is a better alternative? To answer this question, one simply needs to look at the leaders and organizations that have been thriving by doing good long before the above ideas became vogue. Patagonia, Tata, Faber-Castell, Mars and many other companies have been doing well by doing good for decades, if not hundreds of years.Were they less profit- and growth-oriented than the average company? No. Were they led by self-sacrificing servant leaders? No. Were they led by socialist leaders? No.They wanted profits and growth as much as anyone else, but they deeply understood a concept that most people find it difficult to grasp: The more you give, the more you receive. Leaders of such companies saw themselves as stewards of planet Earth and humanity, and proactively decided that they wanted to be successful by solving human problems and making society better off. They strongly believed that if they created business models that profitably solve the most pressing social problems, their companies would be more successful over the long term.At the Stewardship Asia Centre, we have been studying such leaders for over a decade now. It turns out that rather than incentives, regulation, or a philanthropic or socialist leaning, they are driven by a proactive choice to do well by doing good. We call it steward leadership, which is the genuine desire and persistence to create a collective better future for stakeholders, society, future generations, and the environment.Rather than fighting human nature, steward leadership takes today’s challenges head on without compromising personal ambition, profit, or growth. In fact, steward leadership uses personal ambition and profit as tools to solve the challenges in a win-win-win way. Steward leaders make proactive choices (of creating profitable solutions to social and environmental challenges) that stem from underlying values.The Steward Leadership Compass.Stewardship Asia Centre1. Interdependence:View the world as an interconnected system in which your success depends on the success of others.2. Long-term view:Create sustained value for both current and future generations.3. Ownership mentality:Take proactive responsibility to create positive environmental and social impact.4. Creative resilience:Persist to find innovative solutions to disruptive challenges.The solution to save the world lies less in pushing more carrots and sticks, and more in creating a values-based revolution through inspirational education around steward leadership. We have always known that intrinsic motivation is more powerful than its extrinsic cousin. It is time we stepped up our efforts to inspire more people to take up steward leadership because it aims to drive personal success by giving the world what it needs. In corporate parlance, it aims to maximize profit by maximizing purpose.Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outsome of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades"

Opinions expressed are those of the author.| Membership (fee-based)Feb 26, 2025, 08:15am ESTSave ArticlegettyManaging a brand’s reputation is growing more complicated in today’s socially conscious, constantly connected world. Although many companies have publicly committed to embracing more ethical practices, transparency and purpose-driven strategies in recent years to build trust and long-term loyalty among consumers, shifting socioeconomic and political landscapes have made the question of how to leverage these initiatives more complex.The process of meeting consumer expectations is not one-size-fits-all, or even most, and as the business world’s embrace of concepts like CSR, DEI and ESG continues to evolve, brands are revisiting and refining their approaches to managing their reputations. Here, 14 members ofForbes Agency Councilexplore how brands today are enhancing and protecting their reputations while highlighting their purpose and values in terms of society and the environment.1. Advancing Environmental RestorationEnvironmental restoration—not just protection—will become the new frontier for brand reputation management. ConsiderPatagonia’s shiftfrom sustainable cotton to regenerative agriculture: Instead of “doing less harm,” the brand is now actively rebuilding soil health. This evolution from sustainability to environmental restoration tells a powerful redemption story that consumers crave. -Megan Cunningham,Magnet Media, Inc.2. Integrating ESG Into Strategy And CultureWe believe leading companies embed ESG into their purpose and values. By integrating social and environmental responsibility into strategy and culture, businesses foster transparency, accountability and trust. This approach endures economic challenges, retains top talent, ensures sustainability, drives financial success and benefits all—employees, clients, communities and the planet. -Anne St. Peter,Global Prairie3. Ensuring The Ethical Use Of Technology And AIBrands will put a measure of focus on ethical technology used by their companies in 2025. Consumer data privacy and ethical use of AI are increasingly at the forefront of cultural conversations. Savvy corporations will be proactive and enact policies that work to increase consumer trust when it comes to their online and digital brand interactions. -Henry Kurkowski,One WiFi4. Managing AI’s Impact On Brand ReputationBrands will need to manage their reputations surrounding AI in 2025. If they choose to use AI, they will need to address the impact it has on the environment, the impact it has on human workers and the impact it has on the quality of a brand’s work. As in all other areas of CSR, DEI and ESG, transparency will be essential. -Evan Nison,NisonCoForbes Agency Councilis an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies.Do I qualify?5. ‘Walking The Talk’ To Avoid GreenwashingIn 2025, brands will ensure they “walk the talk.” Up to now, it’s been possible to gloss over failings in ESG, CSR and DEI, but that will stop in 2025. A combination of legislation, led by the European Union, and activists looking for organizations that promise a lot, but fail to deliver in practice, will mean that 2025 is the year greenwashing dies for many companies. -Mike Maynard,Napier Partnership Limited6. Making Purpose-Driven Efforts VisibleAs most organizations tap into CSR, DEI and ESG, they have become a part of many brands. What makes a brand stand out is its purpose: why a brand is doing it. Making these initiatives a cohesive part of brand storytelling remains the best way to demonstrate all these efforts to the public and to resonate with the brand’s audience. -Oksana Matviichuk,OM Strategic Forecasting7. Highlighting Transparent, Ethical SourcingThis year, brands will focus on supply chain transparency. Consumers demand to know where products come from and the ethical, sustainable practices behind them. By showcasing transparent sourcing and production processes, brands can build trust, align with societal values and stand out in a market increasingly driven by responsibility and purpose. -Guy Leon Sheetrit,Guac Digital8. Focusing On Purpose-Driven StorytellingThis year, we predict brands will focus on purpose-driven storytelling that ties their services directly to social causes. Instead of just promoting values, they’ll integrate purpose into their messaging and campaigns, allowing consumers to see the impact of their choices. This approach will build deeper connections and spread brand awareness. -Ajay Prasad,GMR Web Team9. Emphasizing Real Action Over OpticsBrands will prioritize authenticity and accountability in CSR, DEI, and ESG efforts, ensuring these initiatives align with their core mission. Consumers are increasingly skeptical of performative activism and demand transparency, measurable impact and long-term commitment. Expect more brands to integrate responsibility into operations rather than marketing, emphasizing real action over optics. -Christy Saia-Owenby,MOXY Company10. Empowering Community-Centric CSR Through EGCIn 2025, community-centric CSR will take center stage, and the brands that amplify employee voices will stand out. Humans value authentic, localized impact, not just broad ESG claims. Employee-generated content will be key, turning real stories of engagement into powerful thought leadership. Let those driving the change tell the story. -Amy Packard Berry,Sparkpr11. Leaning Into Climate EquityThis year, I think we’ll see brands leaning hard into climate equity—tackling environmental issues while addressing social inequality. It’s not just about cutting emissions anymore; it’s about doing it in a way that helps underserved communities. People want to see companies walk the talk, and this approach feels real and impossible to ignore in the current landscape. -Jacquelyn LaMar Berney,VI Marketing and Branding12. Emphasizing Regenerative Business PracticesBrands will emphasize regenerative business practices, moving beyond sustainability to actively restore resources and ecosystems. This focus addresses consumer demand for impactful change, showcasing accountability and innovation while aligning with societal expectations for measurable environmental and social progress. -Vaibhav Kakkar,Digital Web Solutions13. Showing Accountability Through Measurable ImpactAccountability will take center stage. In 2025, consumers won’t just expect brands to talk about impact—they’ll demand measurable proof. Greenwashing is no longer an option; brands will focus on verifiable ESG results, third-party audits and real-time impact tracking to build trust. Companies that show, not just tell, through data-backed progress will win consumer loyalty and long-term credibility. -Solomon Thimothy,OneIMS14. Leveraging Tech To Ensure Ethical PracticesIn 2025, brands will prioritize supply chain transparency to meet consumer demands for ethical practices and sustainability while complying with stricter regulations. Efforts will include carbon-neutral goals, ethical labor and circular economy models, supported by technologies like blockchain for traceability. This focus builds trust, mitigates risks and enhances competitive differentiation. -Jonathan Johnson,Streamline ResultsCheck outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"

The asset manager and its CEO, Larry Fink, have over the years become targets for Republicans who claim the firm is too ""woke.""What was the DEI section in the asset manager's last report has now been reframed as ""connectivity and inclusivity"" inthe Tuesday filing. Last year, it said that it believed ""a diverse workforce with an inclusive and connected culture is a commercial imperative and indispensable to its success.""This year it avoided mentioning the acronym or a diverse workforce, just ""diverse perspectives.""When reached for comment, a BlackRock spokesman referred to the new paragraph in its annual report that said the firm's approach to ""building a connected and inclusive culture is aligned with the firm's business priorities and long-term objectives. Delivering for the firm's clients requires attracting the best people from across the world.""BlackRock is committed to creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid groupthink.""BlackRock has also removed references to a three-pillar strategy, which included phrasing around cultivating a work environment where employees felt ""seen, heard, valued, and respected.""The firm left out a section that previously broke down its US employees by gender and ethnicity. In its 2023 annual review, it introduced the statistics with a line saying that ""BlackRock views transparency and measurement as critical to its strategy.""Companies have been quick to respond to President Donald Trump's executive order on ""radical and wasteful"" DEI programs, though a few big names such as JPMorgan Chase and Costco have reaffirmed their commitment to diversity initiatives.Through his annual investor letters, Fink promoted stakeholder capitalism and environmental, social, and governance investing, becoming the unofficial corporate poster child for the movements. In the last few years, however, Fink has had to tone down his support for ESG and defend against the idea that the firm has an ideological agenda it's forcing on the many companies it invests in through its mutual funds and ETFs.The firm also has critics on the political left. Climate activists have previously protested outside Fink's home and BlackRock's New York headquarters, calling for a divestment from fossil fuels.""The only agenda we have is delivering for our clients,"" he said in 2023 LinkedIn post, which he drafted as a response to being called the ""king of the woke industrial complex"" in a Republican Party presidential candidate debate.Here is a timeline of how BlackRock built and then knocked down its reputation as a social and environmental champion:October 2017:Former Obama aide (and future Biden administration member) Brian Deese is named head of sustainable investments.November 2017:As part of a panel at the New York Times DealBook conference, Fink was asked about how diversity and inclusion are becoming investment criteria. He responded by saying that hiring behaviors will have to change, and they're talking to companies about it. (The clip, where he said, ""You have to force behaviors, and at BlackRock, we are forcing behaviors,"" went viral among conservative circles in 2023.)November 2018:The world's largest asset manager asksRussell 1000 companieswith less than two female board members to improve their gender diversity.January 2020:Fink's annual letter, coming out just months before the COVID-19 pandemic reached New York, stated the company's focus is now on ""putting sustainability at the center of how we invest."" Fink wrote that ""ultimately, purpose is the engine of long-term profitability.""June 2020:Gavin Lewis, a managing director at BlackRock in the UK, starts the #IAM campaign after George Floyd's murder in Minnesota, and Lewis, a Black man, becomes one of the most well-known advocates for people of color in finance.January 2021:Fink lays out the firm'sDEI strategy in his annual letter, which includes more inclusive hiring practices as well as a focus on ""racial equity and social justice in our investment and stewardship activities.April 2021:After a Minneapolis jury convicted police officer Derek Chauvin of murder in the death of George Floyd, Finkwrote on LinkedInthat he hoped the country could begin to heal. ""At BlackRock, we are committed to driving diversity, equity and inclusion through every aspect of our business. While we have made progress, we still have a great deal of work to do,"" he wrote.""This is a somber day and one for deep reflection.

Far from gaining clarity from an ever-broadening array of available media platforms, today’s investors are instead mired in confusion and anxiety and lack trusted information to drive confident decision-making.One significant source of uncertainty: President Trump’s return to the White House. Since the election at the end of last year, markets have been pricing in a mix of deregulatory euphoria (e.g., crypto, fossil fuels) and trade war jitters (e.g., global tariffs), all while theimplosion of narrative-driven bets like GameStop(GME)—once buoyed by social media hype—has left many traders burned, deepening distrust in fleeting trends.Yet, this isn’t 2021. Savvier investors are tuning out the noise, recognizing that while political narratives wax and wane, infrastructure and irreversible trends endure. The lesson of this era is clear: Impact investing isn’t dead but rather hiding in plain sight, anchored in sectors like aging populations, grid modernization and AI’s energy demand. As cynicism and FOMO clash, the focus must shift away from ideology and toward inevitability.‘Green’ Investment Learnings From 2016-2020The previous Trump administration era demonstrated an interesting paradox in green investing. Even as the administration pursued fossil-fuel-friendly policies, several market forces converged to strengthen impact investments:•Cost Competitiveness:Utility-scale solar costs and wind costs decreased significantly, driven by technological improvements and economies of scale. This made renewables increasingly competitive with traditional energy sources purely on economic merit.•Private Sector Leadership:Major corporations like Apple and Walmart accelerated their ESG commitments, creating a private-sector momentum independent of federal policy. Many companies set ambitious renewable energy targets and invested in their own clean energy projects.•Risk Recognition:Extreme weather events and grid unreliability during this period highlighted the importance of resilient, diversified energy infrastructure, encouraging investors to factor climate risks into their portfolios.•Market Innovation:The period saw significant innovation in green financial products and impact investing vehicles, making sustainable investments more accessible to both institutional and retail investors.The key lesson? While supportive policy can accelerate green investment, market forces—including cost competitiveness, private sector leadership and risk management—can also drive sustainable investment, even in a deregulatory environment. This suggests that impact investing can be resilient across different political cycles.Predictions For The Current AdministrationThe current administration’s deregulatory stance may curb federal climate spending, but market pragmatism and global momentum will drive the next phase of green investing. Red states like Texas (now theU.S. leader in wind/solar development) and Georgia (theEV battery hub) will paradoxically fuel the energy transition; bluntly, jobs will take precedence over ideology. Impact capital will follow these “pragmatic green zones,” where renewables align with economic growth.Globally, U.S. firms will sidestep domestic uncertainty by targeting high-growth markets, such asIndia’s solar boom,Saudi Arabia’s hydrogen megaprojectsandMorocco’s tax-advantaged battery supply chains. Meanwhile, Big Tech’s insatiable energy demand (see Microsoft’s nuclear deals or Amazon’s 24/7 carbon-free pledge) will quietly bankroll next-generation infrastructure like small modular reactors and AI-optimized grids.The bottom line: The energy transition is no longer policy-dependent—it’s profit-driven. Investors should focus on global infrastructure builders (e.g., Siemens Energy), red-state renewables and tech’s $1 trillion energy wallet. Private capital and measurable outcomes (CO2 avoided, jobs created) will replace partisan rhetoric as the North Star for impact.Practical Steps For InvestorsParticularly in times of upheaval, investors should anchor portfolios in irreversible impact trends, not political noise. They must prioritize sectors where societal need and policy momentum align. Some examples (to be clear, these are just that—examples—notinvestment recommendations) of that elusive nexus of social trends and economic growth:• Energy Transition Infrastructure:Copper and lithium miners with ethical sourcing (e.g., Freeport-McMoRan’s IRA-driven U.S. projects) and grid modernization plays (e.g., Quanta Services).•Climate Adaptation:Water scarcity solutions (Xylem’s desalination tech) and wildfire-resilient infrastructure (Aeroflex’s fireproof materials).•Inclusive Healthcare:Obesity drug manufacturers (Novo Nordisk) and senior living innovators leveraging AI for aging-in-place (e.g., CarePredict).Tactically, it’s wise to hedge volatility with global clean energyETFs(e.g., ICLN, which prioritizes wind/solar leaders like Orsted) and “stealth” impact sectors like sustainable materials (e.g., recycled steel giant Nucor). And investors should take care to avoid speculative narratives, using tools like ESG Analytics to screen for greenwashing in “AI-for-climate” stocks.The bottom line: Impact investing thrives where structural demand meets measurable outcomes. Stay liquid withT-bills (5%+ yields)to pivot as policies solidify, but focus on solving problems that outlast election cycles.Where Optimism And Pragmatism MeetFor investors who are still skittish, it may be helpful to reflect on an old concept: the dividends ofcollective action.The global economy is a complex, adaptive system—resilient precisely because it’s decentralized (dynamically, but with critical centralized structures). While U.S. political theater may be dominating headlines, underlying innovation remains bipartisan: Consider red-state geothermal breakthroughs, blue-state offshore wind and global alliances like the Global Methane Pledge.Economic history shows that periods of upheaval (such as the 1970sstagflationor the 2008 crisis) ultimately spawn transformative industries. The key to capitalizing on these opportunities is to filter out divisive noise and focus on convergence—where climate urgency, AI-driven efficiency and demographic shifts (e.g., Gen-Z’s ESG expectations) align.Division is a luxury we can’t afford; impact investing is the bridge between profit and purpose.Forbes Finance Councilis an invitation-only organization for executives in successful accounting, financial planning and wealth management firms.Do I qualify?Follow me onLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"
How The Purpose Pledge Is Redefining Business Ethics In The Trump Era,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/errolschweizer/2025/03/03/how-the-purpose-pledge-is-redefining-business-ethics-in-the-trump-era/,"BusinessFood & DrinkHow The Purpose Pledge Is Redefining Business Ethics In The Trump EraByErrol Schweizer, Contributor.Errol Schweizer has the essential take on the grocery industry.Follow AuthorMar 03, 2025, 07:00am ESTSave ArticleCommentThe Purpose Pledge is a coalition of food and wellness brands focused on sustainability and economic... [+]justice.The Purpose PledgeA new coalition of food and wellness companies is looking to redefine business ethics in the Trump era. Called The Purpose Pledge, these companies are creating a community of practice based on economic fairness, environmental sustainability, and independent governance. As major food and beverage conglomerates arebeating a hasty retreatfrom their previousESG, sustainabilityandDEI commitments,The Purpose Pledgeis pointing a new way forward.The Purpose Pledge was initiatedin 2022 by Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soaps, worker cooperative consultancy LIFT Economy, and the nonprofit organization One Step Closer. “The Purpose Pledge is a call for meaningful action. We’re inviting the world’s most exceptional purpose-driven companies to challenge themselves and each other to take even bigger steps forward. I believe that this effort can be a global beacon for change in how business is done,” said Lara Dickinson, co-founder and Executive Director of One Step Closer.The ten Purpose Pledge commitments include product quality, independent governance, supply chain integrity, fair and balanced compensation, living wages, inclusion, community engagement, climate positivity, circularity for zero waste and capability building. Participating pilot companies include Dr. Bronner’s, Gaia Herbs, Guayakí Yerba Mate, Kuli Kuli, Lundberg Family Farms, Mountain Rose Herbs, MUD\WTR, Nature’s Path Organic Foods, Numi Tea, Organically Grown Company, Pachamama Coffee Farmers, Philosopher Foods, SIMPLi, and Wildway.A Dr. Bronner's toothpaste promotion at Costco.Errol Schweizer“It’s not a marketing vehicle,”according to Les Szabo, Dr. Bronner’s chief strategy and impact officer.“It’s about transparency. Consumers will be able to go to the website and look up a company to see how they are progressing with their commitments.” The companies, many of which already are Certified Organic, Non-GMO, fair labor or regeneratively grown, are building a “community that fosters collaboration and shared accountability around… how we define what it means to be an authentic, purpose-led business.”The Pledge grew out of a shared frustration over greenwashing in the food industry.Pledge participantssee it ascomplimentary to B Corp certification, which has come under fire for allowing companies with significant ethical and environmental issues to carry the same label as much higher performing brands. The Pledge also runs counter to widespread DEI and ESG backsliding by major food and retail companies in the early days of the second Trump presidency. David Bronner, CEO of Dr. Bronner’s, noted, “There’s that tendencyto go along to get along — to kiss the ring of power… administrations come and go. We’ll ride this moment out.”MORE FOR YOUOscars 2025 Full Winners List (Live Updates)Oscar Winners: ‘Anora’ Wins Best Picture While Adrien Brody And Mikey Madison Take Home Top Acting HonorsIndia Beat New Zealand To Face Down Australia In Champions Trophy SemiAnd by requiring progress on living wages, compensation and governance, The Purpose Pledge prioritizes workers that companies rely on, but typically take advantage of.At least half of theten lowest-paid jobs in the US are in the food industry, which is the largest employer in the United States. According to the Food Chain Workers Alliance,compared to workers in otherindustries, frontline food industry personnel are 68% more likely to live below the poverty line and continue to be among the lowest paid workers in the U.S., earning a median income of $28,000 per year.Eighty-six percent of food workerssurveyed earn poverty wages and only 13.5 percent make a living wage. Women in the food industry earn 66% of what men are paid and frontline food workers are more likely to be women of color, people of color, and immigrants than the general workforce. Food workers are also more likely to be food insecure than their peers in any other industry. In 2022, frontline food workers were 93% more likely to be food insecure, and food workers were 60% more likely to rely on SNAP.The food industry is just a microcosm of the economic inequality and desperation thatthe Biden/Harris Administration failedto mitigate andenabled the Trump campaign to cruise to victory. Declining real wages and the increased cost of living has put enormous pressures on working people. Aboutone in three Americans say they’re strugglingto afford their usual expenses andmore Americans are having difficulty paying bills.Over one in three Black adults and nearly two in five Hispanic adults were food insecure in 2023, and over 47 million people lived in households experiencing food insecurity, an increase of 13.5 million compared to 2021. Poverty is up 65% since 2021, child poverty has tripled and 67% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. If wages had kept pace with productivity since 1975, Americans would havea $24 an hour minimum wage, and would have earned nearly $50 trillion in additional income, or over$2.5 Trillion annually.While some states haveincreased their minimum wages through ballot measures, thefederal minimum wage sits at $7.25, and hasn’t increased since 2009.Nature's Path cereal display at PCC Natural Markets in Seattle, Washington.Errol SchweizerMeanwhile, the average cost of a loaf of white breadhas increasedfrom $1.38 to $1.94 since 2020, a change of over 40 percent, while beef, eggs, and many processed consumer goods have gone up even more.All in all, grocery prices have climbedover 30% in the past five years, driven largely byoutsized profits from consolidationthroughout the supply chain. So while they pander to the Trump Administration by cancelling DEI and ESG promises, the largest food and retail companies are benefiting from the crisis.Astudyby the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank found that corporate profits drove half of the price increases in 2021 alone. Consumer packaged goods companies in particularsaw record profits, coasting off higher input costs,media hysteriaover supply chain crunches, smaller pack sizes and lower unit volumes.Walmart captured 30% of SNAP shoppers’grocery dollars and over 94% of SNAP recipients said they shopped at Walmart.Walmart and McDonald’shave the most employees using SNAP, and 70 percent of SNAP recipients worked full-time every week, their benefits barely lasting two weeks into the month.The major economicgains of the Covid-19 pandemic were concentrated among the top 1% of earners, particularly the top 0.1%, includingWalmart’s Walton family who saw their net worthskyrocket by tens of billions of dollars. On average, CEOs make 399 times what their workers earn, but this ratio is dwarfed by leading food companies such as Coca-Cola (1,883 times), McDonald’s (1,224), Walmart (933), and Kroger (671).Dr. Bronner's endcap at Kimberton Whole Foods.Errol SchweizerThese are the structural economic issues that The Purpose Pledge community is up against.It is why this movement of brands is prioritizing living wages, fair compensation and independent governance in their business models. But like the employee owned enterprises, unionized companies, and consumer and workercooperativesthat have tried to do likewise, theymuststill grow and turn profits to survive in a competitive marketplace. What then may be just as compelling to The Purpose Pledge is thatstudyafterstudyshows thatconsumers continue to gravitateto companies leading with strong values, fairness and sustainability. It is not altruism, but a new set of business ethics.In an era when the largest food companies are tripping over themselves to win the race to the bottom, a small group of like-minded businesses is instead stepping up. Their success will show that despite heavy competition in the marketplace and reactionary pressures from the current administration, food brands can still do better by doing better. So while today The Purpose Pledge may seem ambitious and even aspirational, someday it may just be brass tacks, just a humble baseline for doing business in the United States and beyond.Follow me onLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"
CSRD In The U.S.: What Companies Need To Know And How To Prepare,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/03/04/csrd-in-the-us-what-companies-need-to-know-and-how-to-prepare/,"InnovationCSRD In The U.S.: What Companies Need To Know And How To PrepareByTed Kail, Forbes Councils Member.forForbes Technology CouncilCOUNCIL POSTExpertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author.| Membership (fee-based)Mar 04, 2025, 07:30am ESTSave ArticleTed Kail is the Chief Product Officer atCority, overseeing Product Management, Solution Marketing and Enablement.gettyAs the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) takes effect, U.S. companies with operations in the EU face a transformative moment.This ambitious directive, whichreplacedthe Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) in January 2024,expands reporting requirementsto include a broader scope of businesses. Last week, CSRD faced additional changes due to the announcement of theEU Omnibus Simplification Packages. For American companies, the CSRD is not just about compliance—it’s an opportunity to integrate sustainability into their core operations and unlock competitive advantages in a rapidly evolving global market.Here’s what U.S. companies need to know about the CSRD, its recent change in requirements and how they can prepare.Understanding The CSRD’s Scope And ImpactThe CSRD introduces a comprehensive framework that influences both EU-based companies and international businesses with significant operations within the EU. A key feature of the directive is the requirement for companies to report on ""double materiality."" This means they must assess how sustainability issues impact their financial performance and how their operations affect people and the planet.Recent changes to the CSRD requirements have reduced the coverage of the regulation. Now, only large companies—those with 1,000 or more employees and either a turnover exceeding EUR 50 million or a balance sheet total above EUR 25 million—are mandated to report. As a result, approximately 80% fewer companies will need to comply with a majority of listed small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) now exempted, adding to the exemption already in place for SMEs not publicly listed.In terms of reporting standards, the directive has removed the already delayed sector-specific requirements. This means that requirements will remain as a single set of rules for all sectors. This is in response to concerns from various sectors related to the complexity of adhering to different standards and the potential for extensive additional requirements above and beyond what was already in place.Finally, the reporting deadlines have been adjusted. Companies in the second and third waves can defer compliance for an additional two years, with the aim of providing them more time to prepare.So what do these changes mean for U.S. companies?Mid-sized U.S. companies with EU subsidiaries that were previously in scope may no longer have to prepare CSRD disclosures. However, it’s important to note that large U.S. companies are still required to comply with these regulations.If your company was gearing up for CSRD reporting in 2026-2027, you might find you have additional time to streamline your ESG data collection and enhance your ESG strategies.Moreover, even if your U.S. company is not directly obligated to comply with the CSRD, you may encounter pressure from EU clients and partners due to supply chain due diligence practices.Conducting A Gap AnalysisFor U.S. companies, preparing for the CSRD should start with a comprehensive gap analysis. This critical step helps identify discrepancies between current reporting practices and the directive’s requirements, shedding light on areas where processes and data collection fall short.Beyond compliance, a gap analysis can reveal opportunities to enhance sustainability performance, manage risks and engage stakeholders more effectively. In working with companies to conduct gap analyses to align their reporting framework with ESRS standards, I've found the key to success is to—through workshops and strategic planning—not only address immediate areas for improvement but also build a robust foundation for future audits and sustainability disclosures.Engaging Stakeholders Through Double MaterialityDouble materiality lies at the heart of the CSRD. This approach requires assessing financial risks and opportunities alongside broader societal and environmental impacts. Engaging internal and external stakeholders—employees, customers, investors and NGOs—ensures a holistic view of material concerns, paving the way for more meaningful reporting.For example, a global investment firm preparing for CSRD compliance conducted a double materiality analysis that considered supply chain impacts and stakeholder feedback. These types of insights can provide a clearer understanding of sustainability risks and opportunities, which will enable your organization to align its strategies with regulatory expectations and stakeholder priorities.The Role Of Technology In Streamlining ComplianceThe CSRD's extensive reporting requirements demand advanced tools and technologies. Software solutions can simplify data collection, aggregation and reporting by centralizing sustainability data, automating quality checks and aligning outputs with ESRS and other frameworks like the GRI.CSRD also requires companies to useXBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) formatin their ESG reporting for increased consistency and accessibility. Many organizations struggle with the technical complexities of integrating these tools into their processes. Partnering with technology providers and leveraging software can help bridge these gaps, ensuring compliance while reducing the burden on internal teams.Moving Beyond ComplianceWhile meeting the CSRD’s requirements is essential, companies should view compliance as a step toward broader sustainability integration. Each reporting cycle offers an opportunity to refine data collection, improve transparency and embed sustainability into business operations.Reporting to the CSRD isn’t just about ticking boxes—it’s a chance for companies to lead in sustainability and demonstrate accountability to investors, customers and regulators. Organizations that embrace this directive as a catalyst for change will be better positioned to thrive in an increasingly sustainability-focused global economy.The CSRD’s implementation marks a watershed moment in sustainability reporting. By taking proactive steps to understand its requirements, address gaps and invest in the right tools and strategies, U.S. businesses can not only achieve compliance but also drive innovation, enhance stakeholder trust and create lasting value.The time to act is now.Forbes Technology Councilis an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.Do I qualify?Follow me onLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"
The WOKE WAR on gaming: How Mark Kern and gamers are fighting back against DEI corruption,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Naturalnews.com'}",https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-03-02-mark-kern-gamers-fighting-back-dei-corruption.html,"The video game industry has become a focal point in the culture war, with DEI initiatives and ESG funding driving progressive activism in game development. This has led to criticism that games now prioritize political messaging over creativity and gameplay.Former Blizzard developer Mark Kern, a key figure behind iconic games like World of Warcraft and Diablo II, is leading a movement against what he calls the ""woke agenda."" He argues that modern games have sacrificed quality storytelling and character design in favor of tokenism and ideological conformity.ESG funding incentivizes studios to adopt DEI initiatives to secure financial backing. This has led to the hiring of consultancy firms like Sweet Baby Inc., which critics claim prioritize inclusivity over compelling narratives and gameplay, resulting in poorly received titles like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.Kernâs call for a two-year boycott of AAA games from ""woke"" studios has gained traction, with over 250,000 gamers joining the ""Sweet Baby Inc. Detected"" group on Steam. Games free from DEI influence, such as Black Myth: Wukong and Stellar Blade, have seen success, highlighting demand for apolitical, fun-focused games.As ESG funding declines and poorly received games lead to financial losses and layoffs, Kern sees an opportunity for the industry to course-correct. He believes the failure of DEI-driven games signals a need to return to quality storytelling and gameplay, with gamers and industry insiders uniting to restore the mediumâs creative integrity."

[+]million to 4.7 million. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesKey FactsOn blackout day, Target website visitors dropped 9% compared to Friday, Feb. 14, from 5.2 million to 4.7 million.Target app user traffic, representing the most loyal Target customers, was off even more, down 14%, from 4.2 million to 3.5 million.By comparison, Costco experienced a 22% rise in Feb. 28 web traffic, from 2.4 million Feb. 14 to 2.9 million and Costco app user visits rose 3%, from 1.3 million to 1.34 million.On blackout day, the nation’s number one retailer, Walmart, experienced a 5% slump in web traffic, down from 11.7 million on Feb. 14 to 11.2 million and number two Amazon dropped by 2%, from 67.1 million to 65.9 million.However, Amazon app traffic rose 1% to 51.4 million visitors while Walmart’s dropped 2% to 13.6 million.BackgroundEver sinceTarget announcedat the end of January that it had concluded its three-year diversity, equity and inclusion goals, calls for boycotts against Target have been growing, most recently with Black faith and civil rights leaders advocating for a 40-day “Target Fast” over Lent starting this Ash Wednesday. About the same time as Target was dialing back DEI,Costco affirmedits strong DEI commitment after striking down a proxy vote to evaluate its current policy’s risks in light of rising anti-DEI political and legal pressure. While website traffic can rise and fall sharply on any given day for any number of reasons, it would appear that Target is beginning to experience pullback from its most loyal app-user customer base.What We Don’t KnowTarget reports full-year 2024 earnings tomorrow at 9 a.m. ET and its fourth quarter will only include results covering a week or so after the DEI pushback began. So we’ll have to wait for next quarter to see impact from the boycott calls. However, Target gave a sneak peek at holiday results and reported a2.8% net sales increaseover November and December, including a nearly 9% increase in digital sales compared to prior year.TangentBlackrock, the world’s largest investment firm and one of the leading advocates for strong DEI and environmental, social and governance policies, has been “walking back” its ESG/DEI positions, theWall Street Journalreported. Last Friday, it told employees it was ending “aspirational workforce representation goals” as a result of “significant changes to the U.S. legal and policy environment.”Crucial Quote“In recent days, we have witnessed a disturbing retreat from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives by major corporations—companies that once pledged to stand for justice but have since chosen the path of compromise. These rollbacks represent more than just corporate decisions; they reflect a deeper erosion of the moral and ethical commitments necessary to build a just society. As people of faith, we cannot be silent. We are called to resist systems that perpetuate exclusion and inequity,” states theTargetFast.org website.Further ReadingBlackRock’s ‘Woke’ Era Is Over(Wall Street Journal, 2/2/2025)ForbesAre Target Boycotts Starting To Take Their Toll?ByPamela N.

What’s Behind the Secret Walls of Family Offices?,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Upenn.edu'}",https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/whats-behind-the-secret-walls-of-family-offices/,"The term “family office” couldn’t be a more innocuous moniker. These entities, shrouded in secrecy, are close, trusted friends and confidants to wealthy families and ultra-high-net-worth individuals, providing them with advice on how to invest the family money. Their influence extends across those “substantial families,” their family businesses and family foundations, to succession planning and safeguarding the family’s legacy, prosperity, and harmony.The newly releasedseventh biannual survey by the Wharton Global Family Alliance (WGFA)brings rare insights into how family offices function. “A key learning is that family offices are a lot more than simply private asset management companies,” said Wharton management professorRaphael (Raffi) Amit, cofounder and chairman of the WGFA. “They are in fact the backbone for a family, addressing a broad range of issues beyond investment management that contribute to family harmony and prosperity.”What Is a Family Office?The Wharton Global Family Alliance defines a family office as a professional organization dedicated to serving the broad interests and needs of an affluent family in a way that preserves family harmony and unity while also growing its financial, human, and social capital.The WGFA combines “the practical expertise of highly successful global families and rigorous scholarly analysis from Wharton researchers,” according to an executive summary of the WGFA survey.Financial Performance in InvestingThe WFGA survey tracked the investment avenues of family offices across 21 countries in Q1 2024, the size of the assets they manage, and the returns on those investments. More than 40% of the respondents had assets under management of more than $1 billion, while a quarter of them had assets of between $500 million and $1 billion; the remainder had less than $500 million.Source:LinkedInAbout 45% of those respondents earned average annual net returns of more than 10% over the five-year period ending December 2023; none of them reported negative net returns in that period. The top three asset classes were public equity (34%), private equity (22%), and real estate (10%).Even as the average family office appears to have made sound investments in its future wealth, they face disconcerting trends on other fronts. For one, the role of the next generation in the family office is fairly limited: about a fifth of next-generation members are not involved in the family office, and only about 12% of them may work in the family office in the future.According to Amit, the upshot of those findings is that the next generation in substantial families may not be ready to deal with the complexities of succession in ownership, management, and control.“Succession planning isn’t just a good business process; it’s a safeguard for a family’s legacy, harmony, and sustained success,” Amit said. “Without it, the risks extend beyond the family, often impacting professional teams as well, as new generations seek to establish their own leadership and step away from ‘dad’s team.’”“[The survey reveals that] families struggle with putting structure, process, and formality around family succession and transitions.”— Raphael (Raffi) AmitHurdles to Succession PlanningA key finding of the survey is that only a third of family offices have formal or informal plans for ownership, management, and control transitions; only a third of stakeholders are aware of these plans. “Clearly, families struggle with putting structure, process, and formality around family succession and transitions,” Amit said in one of a series ofLinkedIn postspublished late last year jointly withPaul Carbone, cofounder and vice chairman of Pritzker Private Capital. “That’s because they face overarching challenges during transitions from concentrated to dispersed ownership.”Those challenges include reaching consensus on major issues; balancing diverse interests/viewpoints of family members; managing the liquidity needs of different generations while trying to preserve the real value of the family’s wealth; and attracting and retaining outside talent while keeping family members involved in the business. “Neglecting to deal with those challenges can have serious implications for family cohesion, legacy, and the family dynamic,” Amit said.Source:LinkedInThose disconnects may have something to do with the mission statements of family offices. As it happens, only half of family offices that were surveyed have a mission statement. “Failing to have a mission statement that has been developed by the family, and which has gained broad family acceptance, will only make a period of transition all the more dangerous,” Amit cautioned. “Perhaps that is why more families are now turning to non-family members to lead, and merit-based factors — like expertise in family dynamics and industry experience — are prioritized over seniority or ownership when selecting the next leader.”Slow to Adopt AI, New TechnologyAnother potentially worrisome trend is the slow pace of adoption of AI and other emerging technologies by family offices. “The implications of these results are significant as the cost profile of family office investing may remain higher and their investing effectiveness negatively impacted, potentially resulting in suboptimal returns that could erode over time,” Carbone said in aLinkedIn post. “Consequently, families may need to consider outsourcing more of their investment strategies to those with a competitive cost structure and technological advantage.”Family offices may be slow to embrace AI and other technologies because they want to avoid the pains on the learning curve and avoid false starts, Carbone wrote. “Broader adoption will first require existing challenges to be overcome and trust to be built in these powerful tools.”“Failing to have a mission statement that has been developed by the family, and which has gained broad family acceptance, will only make a period of transition all the more dangerous.”— Raphael (Raffi) AmitThe survey pointed to other technology aspects that may warrant attention: On average, family offices employ less than one IT professional, and few of those are cybersecurity experts. Also, only half of respondents have an IT disaster recovery plan.Direct Private Investments: Surprising TrendsThe survey revealed that nearly half of the families it tracked made direct private investments, without staffing up with private equity professionals. Surprisingly, only 12% of families consider investing in other family businesses central to their strategy. That is “despite the clear advantages family capital holds when invested alongside like-minded users of capital who understand its unique value,” Amit noted.A puzzling trend here was that only 15% of families hold investments for more than 10 years. Specifically, the survey showed that family offices held 30% of investments for 3-5 years, while 55% of investments were held for 6-10 years.Source:LinkedInSeventy percent of those direct private investments are syndicated, “with families prioritizing trusted relationships, value alignment, and the ability to add value when selecting syndication partners,” Amit said.Another remarkable finding is that 60% of families make cross-border investments, which reveals their comfort in “navigating the risk of going outside their borders, particularly when they often lack in-house expertise and only hold a minority position.” The reliance on syndicates may explain that confidence, as many families partner with those who have the necessary knowledge in unfamiliar geographies, Amit pointed out.ESG, Philanthropy, and Human CapitalThe survey also covered how family offices go about their ESG investing, philanthropic activities, and human capital. About 35% of respondents have made or plan to make ESG investments. Their approaches are thematic investing such as clean energy, gender equality, health care, and water (33%); integration of ESG factors into analysis (25%); and negative/exclusion-based screening, such as avoiding investments related to tobacco, alcohol, or weapons (18%).About 65% of philanthropic activities are through family foundations. Other philanthropic avenues were giving to charities (31%), giving directly to specific causes (25%), and donor-advised funds (22%). ESG activities and impact investing attracted only 8% of the share of philanthropy.Family offices invested in their human capital by funding continuous education programs. Those efforts have paid off, it appears: The “vast majority of investment and accounting professionals remain with the Family Office for five years or longer,” according to the WGFA executive summary.Read more about the report anddownload and executive summary here."
第５回 不動産投資オーナーのESG意識調査～環境関連法令・諸制度の変更　運用に良い影響～,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Prtimes.jp'}",https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000216.000020953.html,"第５回 不動産投資オーナーのESG意識調査～環境関連法令・諸制度の変更　運用に良い影響～グローバル都市不動産研究所 第32弾（都市政策の第一人者　市川宏雄氏監修）株式会社グローバル・リンク・マネジメント2025年2月26日 10時30分投資用不動産を扱う株式会社グローバル・リンク・マネジメント（本社：東京都渋谷区、以下GLM）は、(1)東京という都市を分析しその魅力を世界に向けて発信すること、(2)不動産を核とした新しいサービスの開発、等を目的に、明治大学名誉教授 市川宏雄 氏を所長に迎え、「グローバル都市不動産研究所（以下、同研究所）」を2019年1月1日に設立しました。▼過去のレポート一覧はこちら詳細を見る同研究所では、調査・研究の第32弾として、全国の投資用不動産保有者400名を対象に、ESGに対する意識調査を実施しました（本調査は2021年から毎年実施し、今回が５回目）。【01】ESGの知名度が初の５割超・「ESG」という言葉を聞いたことがある　初の５割超となる51.3％・企業のESG推進によって株価に直接的な影響が出るとは考えていないようす不動産投資家のESG意識高まるグローバル都市不動産研究所では、全国の投資用不動産所有者400人に、不動産投資のESGに関わる意識調査を行いました。この調査は、2021年から実施しており、今回が５回目です。①ESGの知名度そもそも「ESG」という言葉を聞いたことがあるかを尋ねた結果、聞いたことが「ある」は51.3％でした。前年の47.5％から７ポイント強増加し、初めて半数を超えました。②ESGに対する理解度「ESG」という言葉を聞いたことがあると回答した人に対し、その内容の理解度として、ESGについて知っていることを複数回答で尋ねました。「環境・社会・ガバナンスの略語だということを知っている」と「企業等がESGの枠組みで情報を開示し、投資家が投資判断・評価に用いるものだと知っている」は共に56％前後でした。一方、「ESGに関する投資家の判断・評価は、短期的なリスク・リターンではなく、中長期なリスク・リターンや、投資の環境・社会への影響を考慮するものだと知っている」は48.8%と半数を割り、中長期的な時間軸や社会的な影響範囲に関する理解や認識は比較的伸びしろが大きいといえるでしょう。また、ESGという語句のみを認知しており、知識・理解がない層は約９%弱となりました。③投資活動におけるESGへの意識「ESG」という言葉を聞いたことがあると回答した人に対し、投資活動の中でESGを意識しているかどうかを尋ねました。この結果、「時々意識している」が36.6％で最多となり、次いで「常に意識している」の31.1%と合わせ、７割弱がESGを念頭においた投資を行っていることがわかります。他方、「全く意識していない」は１割を下回り、内容理解の深度を問わず、そもそもESGの語を認知しているかどうかが日頃の投資活動における意識に影響するものといえるでしょう。④ESG対応企業に感じるメリット「ESG」という言葉を聞いたことがあると回答した人に対し、ESG対応が優れている企業に対して感じるメリットを複数回答で尋ねました。この結果、「社会的意義が高いと感じる」が58.5％で最多となり、「長期的な安定成長が期待できる」が45.9％、「投資リスクが低いと感じる」が32.7％、「ブランド価値が向上している」が27%弱と続いています。一方、「株価の持続的な上昇が期待できる」は約12％で、唯一１割台にとどまっています。ESG対応が評価される企業には、直近での株価収益向上に対する期待はさほど高くないながら、企業活動としての社会性の高さが安定経営や将来的な成長に繋がる要素が感じられているものとうかがえます。⑤投資先のESG情報の取得方法「ESG」という言葉を聞いたことがあると回答した人に対し、投資先のESG情報をどのように取得しているかを複数回答で尋ねました。この結果、「専門メディアやレポート」（62.9％）と「企業のIR資料やサステナビリティ報告書」（61.7％）が共に６割超となりました。次いで「証券会社からの情報提供」が約43％、「投資関連のSNSやブログ」が約26％となっていて、「個人調査や企業への問い合わせ」は8.6%にとどまっています。投資先のESGに関する情報は、株式評価機関や投資関連媒体等の第三者によるものと、企業・団体自らが開示・発信するものが概ね同程度の質・量で取得されているといえるでしょう。また、投資家が証券会社による発信情報にも目を通していることがうかがえます。⑥ESG対応企業において重視するポイント「ESG」という言葉を聞いたことがあると回答した人に対し、ESG対応が進んでいる企業についてどの要素を特に重視するか複数回答で尋ねました。この結果、「社会貢献」が59.0%で、「環境対応」の57.6%をわずかに上回り最多となりました。対して「ガバナンス」は37.6%と、両者より20ポイント低くなっています。投資判断においてESGを一定以上意識している層にとっては、企業のS（社会貢献）とE（環境対応）の取り組みの重要度が高いことがうかがえます。同時に、これら二つの領域に比べG（ガバナンス）の取り組みや開示情報の質・量については、各企業が独自性を打ち出しにくい状況にあるともいえるでしょう。【02】ESG物件の価格上昇許容度　許容層は高付加価値傾向・「不動産のESG投資」の注目度は低下傾向・ESG物件の価格上昇　５~６％は許容が最多⑦不動産のESG投資の認知度ESGとは別に、「不動産のESG投資」の認知を尋ねました。「知っていた」は30.0％で、前年に続き微減しました。ESGの語自体の認知度が増加している点とは対照的です。なお「不動産」と「ESG」の両語を合わせて報道する新聞記事数は、2021年をピークに減少しています。⑧不動産のESG投資で重要だと思う分野不動産のESG投資の認知有無を問わず、どのような分野で重要だと思うかを複数回答で尋ねました。この結果、「健康性・快適性」が48.3%でトップ、次いで「気候変動への対応」が40％、「地域社会・経済への寄与」「災害への対応」が約30％となりました。2024年までの調査では、別の設問で「『不動産のESG投資』が投資先を判断する材料・要素として重要だと思う」と答えた人のみを回答対象としていたため割合の単純比較はできませんが、各項目の順位は前年と同様になっています。なお、これまで「災害への対応」の割合は「地域社会・経済への寄与」より５ポイント以上低かったのに対し、今回は1.8ポイントと肉薄しています。コロナ禍において、テレワークや地方移住の促進で上昇した地方創生の機運が一段落したこと、年々多様化・甚大化が著しい災害への対応意識が高まっていることがうかがえます。⑨ESG投資を意識する物件不動産のESG投資の重要度を問わず、どのような物件ならESG投資を意識するか複数回答で尋ねました。この結果、「ワンルーム区分マンション」が37.3％で最多、「ファミリー向け区分マンション」が30.8%、「一棟マンション」が25.8％で次ぎました。前問と同じく2024年までと調査条件が異なるため割合の単純比較はできないものの、トップは前年と同様ながら「一棟マンション」 は「ファミリー向け区分マンション」 と順位が入れ替わり、「戸建て」にも肉薄されています。また、非レジデンスでは「商業施設」と「ホテル」が13％前後と比率が高くなっており、過去最高を記録した訪日外国人客を中心とする観光消費の活性化を背景に、ESG投資のインパクトを期待する意向があると考えられます。⑩ESG対応物件の購入額不動産のESG投資の重要度を問わず、 ESG対応を進めている物件について、購入額の増額に対する意識を尋ねました。「意識はするが、購入費用に差が出ることは許容できない」の回答比率は31.3%で、約７割が増額を許容する結果となりました。許容する層が前年比で約１割減少しましたが、これは前問までと同じく、不動産のESG投資を重視しない層を回答者に含むという調査条件が影響したと考えられます。なお、増額を許容する層のみに着目すると、 前年は「3～4%」の回答比率がトップだったのに対し、今回は「5～6%」が最多となっています。加えて、比率は少ないながら「11％以上」の割合も５年連続微増しています。不動産のESGを重視する層においては、ESG対応物件に対する投資額増加の許容幅が、年々広がっているものと読み取れるでしょう。【03】環境関連法令・諸制度変更　認知度・良い影響ともに向上・環境関連法令・諸制度の変更　認知度が向上・変更によって「運用に良い影響」　51.3％⑪不動産の環境対応の法令・制度変更認知住宅・非住宅の環境に関わる法令・諸制度の変更について、当面の主な動きをいくつか提示し、変更された、ないし今後されることを知っているか尋ねました。前年同様、各キーワードともにおおよそ４～５割が認知していました。認知している割合の増加幅が最も大きいのは、2025年4月の新築物件に対する省エネ基準適合の義務付けで、3.2ポイント増となりました。なお義務化以降は、建築主は建築確認時に適合性審査を受け、基準に合致していないと着工できなくなるため、投資家に対する影響は比較的大きいといえるでしょう。一方で省エネ性能ラベル表示の努力義務化は、昨年4月にすでに開始されているものの、認知層は前年比0.7ポイント増で半数にとどまっています。新築住宅の省エネ性能の政府目標も、認知層は前年比0.8ポイントの微増でした。⑫環境関連法令・制度変更の投資への影響度住宅・非住宅の環境に関わる法令・諸制度の変更について、知っているかどうかを問わず、こうした変更が不動産投資の運用に影響を与えると思うかを尋ねました。この結果、各キーワードともに、55%前後が「良い影響を与える」（「とても良い影響を与えると思う」「良い影響を与えると思う」の合計）と回答し、半数以上がポジティブにとらえていることが分かりました。また、いずれのキーワードについても、ポジティブにとらえている層は前年比で4.5ポイント前後増加しています。投資家においては、法令・制度の認知や変更内容の理解には未だ伸びしろが大きいといえるものの、認知拡大に伴い投資家の影響度評価も向上が進み、環境対応物件に対する投資を後押しすると考えられるでしょう。【04】都市政策の第一人者　市川宏雄所長による分析結果統括・「ESG」の知名度は51.3％に増加し、調査開始以来初の半数超え・ESG対応物件への投資の意味が定着しつつあるESGの知名度が前年の47.5％から51.3％に増加し、初めて半数を超えました。「環境・社会・ガバナンスの略語だということを知っている」と「企業等がESGの枠組みで情報を開示し、投資家が投資判断・評価に用いるものだと知っている」は共に5割を超える回答でした。さらに、７割弱がESGを念頭においた投資を行っていることも判明しました。ESG対応が優れている企業に対して「社会的意義が高い」、「長期的な安定成長が期待できる」と感じています。特に重視するのが、 企業の「社会貢献（S)」と「環境対応（E) 」で、「ガバナンス（G)」をはるかに上回りました。また、投資先のESG情報は、 「証券会社からの情報提供」 よりも、「専門メディアやレポート」と「企業のIR資料やサステナビリティ報告書」が多くなっています。ところが、不動産のESG投資についての認知度は約３割と下がります。不動産のESG投資で重要な分野は、５割弱の回答が「健康性・快適性」で、これに「気候変動への対応」、「地域社会・経済への寄与」、「災害への対応」と続き約３割となります。ESG投資を意識する物件は何かの問いには、約３分の１が「ワンルーム区分マンション」と答えていますが、その比率は年々下がっています。ESG対応物件の購入額の増額について、７割弱が許容していますが、５年間で過去最低となっています。ただし、増額を許容する層のみに限ってみると許容幅が１％上がっており、 ESGの必要性が認識される比率が上がれば、増額受け入れが進むことが予想されます。不動産の環境関連法令や諸制度の変更についての認知度も上がってきています。省エネ性能ラベルの表示が努力義務、省エネ基準適合が義務化、むこう５年でZEH水準の省エネ性能の確保を政府が目指していることなど、こうしたことが良い影響を与えると考える人の回答が約55％となっています。今回が５回目の調査ですが、 ESG対応物件への投資の意味が定着しつつ、そのための対価を払うことの覚悟も芽生えつつありそうです。取材可能事項本件に関して、下記２名へのインタビューが可能です。ご取材をご希望の際は、グローバル・リンク・マネジメントの経営企画室 広報担当までお問い合わせください。・氏名 ：市川 宏雄（いちかわ　ひろお）・生年月日 ：1947年 東京生まれ（77歳）・略歴

"Big banks abandoned a voluntary climate alliance. Now, critics are calling for new laws.","{'id': None, 'name': 'Grist'}",http://grist.org/accountability/big-banks-abandoned-a-voluntary-climate-alliance-now-critics-are-calling-for-new-laws/,"Joseph WintersStaff WriterPublishedMar 03, 2025TopicClimate +             AccountabilityShare/RepublishCopy LinkRepublishCopy LinkEmailSMSXFacebookRepublishRedditLinkedInBlueskyIn the lead-up to Inauguration Day, all six ofthe United States’ largest banksbacked away from a United Nations-sponsored climate initiative amid attacks from conservative lawmakers and regulators.Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo left the Net Zero Banking Alliance between December and January in what was perceived to be a concession to right-wing criticism of so-called ESG — decision-making driven by environmental, social, and corporate governance considerations. Nineteen Republican attorneys general had issued “civil investigative demands” to those banks in 2022, demanding that they turn over information about their ESG practices. They argued that the alliance was beholden to “the woke climate agenda” and that it violated antitrust laws.While the banks’ exodus from the alliance certainly looks like a setback for the banking sector’s climate progress, environmental advocates say it is a reminder that voluntary initiatives have never been sufficient to drive the sector’sdecarbonization.“There are other levers that we can use to hold banks accountable,” said Allison Fajans-Turner, a senior energy finance campaigner at the nonprofit Rainforest Action Network, which publishes anannual reporton how much money banks commit to fossil fuel projects. In light of the Trump administration’s pro-oil and gas agenda, she said that over the next four years, activists and policymakers will have to keep the pressure on and, critically, push for stricter legislation at the state and international levels.Grist thanks its sponsors.Become one.To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please considerdisabling your ad-blockerto allow ads on Grist.Here's How“It is quite clear that major U.S. banks will not police themselves,” she added.The Net Zero Banking Alliance, or NZBA,launched in 2021under the aegis of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative and has about 140 members after the six American banks — andfour Canadian ones— exited. The alliance asks member banks to commit to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across their operations and “lending and investment portfolios” by 2050, and to set intermediary emissions reduction targets for 2030 and every five years thereafter. It also asks banks to disclose their annual emissions, and sets some recommendations to limit the application of carbon offsets toward banks’ climate goals.A Bank of American branch in Chicago.Beata Zawrzel / NurPhoto via Getty ImagesHowever,much like the Paris Agreement to limit global warming, the NZBA relies on voluntary participation and compliance, and does not have any enforcement authority. It’s been criticized for not asking enough from its members, which are allowed to participate even if they continue underwriting the expansion of oil and gas infrastructure. U.N. proposals that would tighten its requirements — particularly around financing of fossil fuels — facedstrong oppositionfrom recently departed banks like JP Morgan and Bank of America.Even some of the NZBA banks themselves have acknowledged the alliance’s limitations in the face of government inaction. In 2023, Amalgamated Bank’s chief sustainability officer, Ivan Frishberg,told the business publication Responsible Investorthat NZBA signatories were “being left alone at the altar” as governments around the world failed to legislate a transition away from fossil fuels. GLS Bank, based in Germany,quit the alliance that same yearin protest of other NZBA members’ support for fossil fuel projects in Africa.Grist thanks its sponsors.Become one.To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please considerdisabling your ad-blockerto allow ads on Grist.Here's HowWells Fargo declined to comment on the rationale behind its departure from the NZBA. Goldman Sachs said it had made “significant progress” on its net-zero goals but did not explain why it left the alliance. The other four recently departed banks did not respond to inquiries from Grist.Unlike voluntary initiatives, governments have the authority to ensure that banks live up to their stated climate promises and to push them to do more. At an event in New York City last November — notably, even before the NZBA shakeup — the former deputy secretary to the U.S. Treasury, Sarah Bloom Raskin, suggested that states should take on this role.States “have a unique opportunity to lead,” she said, noting the incoming presidential administration’s hostility to climate action. At the time, California had alreadypassed two lawsrequiring large businesses, including banks, to report their greenhouse gas emissions annually and disclose their climate-related financial risks biannually. Those laws recently survived a legal challenge from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and New York state lawmakersintroduced similar billsin January. A Democratic state representative in Illinois introduced adisclosure billlast month.Former deputy secretary to the U.S. Treasury, Sarah Bloom Raskin, speaks in front of a Senate committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs in 2022.Ken Cedeno-Pool / Getty ImagesDanielle Fugere, president and chief counsel for the shareholder advocacy nonprofit As You Sow, said disclosure is a prerequisite for holding banks to their climate goals. ”We want to understand what it is they’re doing,” she said. Laws like California’s bring to light the financial instability wrought by fossil fuel-driven climate change and — in theory, at least — discourage financing that would exacerbate it.Of course, merely requiring that banks disclose their emissions and climate-related risks isn’t likely to prevent the worst impacts of global warming. According to alandmark 2021 reportfrom the International Energy Agency, no new oil, gas, and coal infrastructure can be built if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). That’s why Patrick McCully, a senior energy transition analyst for the French nonprofit Reclaim Finance, which advocates for a more sustainable banking sector, said legislators should be “pushing the banks to reduce their financing of fossil fuels.”“These companies are acting against the interests of humanity, and we need to stop them,” he told Grist.Fajans-Turner, however, said a policy of this nature would be difficult to write into law and would likely face legal challenges even in the most progressive states, where natural gas bans on new construction have beenbeaten back by industry groups.Ann Lipton, a business law professor at Tulane University, said a better way for policymakers to limit new fossil fuel projects is to look beyond the banking sector. For instance, lawmakers could require insurance companies to factor in climate-related financial risks when designing their policies — which could make it harder for fossil fuel projects to get coverage. “We would love banks to stop financing risky activities, but at the end of the day, the job of a bank is to finance things that are predictably profitable,” she said. “It’s the job of the rest of society to make that [thing] not profitable.”Another strategy is to require that banks publish a clear decarbonization plan, which can, in theory, be a sort of back door to blocking new fossil fuel investments. “Implicit in having a target is that the bank is taking some kind of action to ensure that it meets that target,” Fugere said. If a plan mentions “net-zero” by a certain date, then to be credible it must involve some sort of scaling back of fossil fuel financing. If it claims to align with a pathway to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C, then it must not enable the expansion of fossil fuels.A Wells Fargo building in Walnut Creek, California.Smith Collection / Gado / Getty ImagesIn the U.S., investors like As You Sow havepressured several big banksinto voluntarily offering more information about their plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but requests for greater detail wererebuffedlastyear. (At least one bank, Wells Fargo, has done an about-face, recentlydropping its net-zero targetaltogether.)Legislation to require detailed decarbonization plans has seen more success on the international stage. The European Union, for instance, is beginning to use two corporate sustainability directives approved by its parliament to require financial institutions to adopt a “transition plan for climate change mitigation.” The laws require institutions to make their “best efforts” to ensure that their plans are compatible with a pathway toward achieving climate neutrality by 2050 and limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C.McCully said these regulations are promising but noted growing opposition to them from right-wing governments in Europe. “We need to defeat that pushback to make sure that legislation is going to be able to survive,” he said.Even as they push for stronger government oversight of the banking industry, organizations like the Rainforest Action Network and Reclaim Finance say they plan to continue drawing connections between the financing of fossil fuel projects and the harm these projects may cause to communities — whether directly, because of the risk of oil spills and explosions, or indirectly because of accelerating climate change. Mass demonstrations and research publications like Rainforest Action Network’s annual report can theoretically increase the public’s appetite for state, national, and international regulation.“It’s hard to be optimistic,” said Quentin Aubineau, a policy analyst at the nonprofit BankTrack, which does research and advocacy around banks’ role in the climate crisis and human rights violations. “But we have a lot of people working on the ground, doing a lot of research, and putting a lot of effort together to try to make a change. I think we will get there, even if it’s not the best environment to work in at the moment.”A message fromYour support keeps our site freeGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

‘Assault On American Sovereignty’: Red State Officials Urge Trump To Probe EU’s Corporate Climate Mandates,"{'id': None, 'name': 'The Daily Caller'}",https://dailycaller.com/2025/02/25/red-states-trump-probe-european-union-corporate-climate-esg/,"Energy‘Assault On American Sovereignty’: Red State Officials Urge Trump To Probe EU’s Corporate Climate Mandates(Photo by Omar Havana/Getty Images)Nick PopeContributorFebruary 25, 20259:43 PM ETFont Size:Twenty-six financial officials from 21 states wrote to President Donald Trump on Tuesday urging him and his administration to review European Union (EU) climate rules applying to U.S. companies operating in Europe as part of his wider reassessment of trade relationships with other countries.The financial officials asked Trump to have the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) open a probe of several EU rules that they say giveEuropean regulatorstoo much discretion over the operations of U.S. companies doing business on the continent. They argue in theirletterthat the EU’s climate mandates have impacts that undermine their ability to protect the finances and investments of their own states. They also say that the Trump administration should consider reviewing those mandates in light of Trump’sexecutive orderto reassess international environmental deals that “unduly or unfairly burden the United States.”“While EU member states are key American trading partners and geopolitical allies, this partnership cannot come at the cost of subjecting American companies to unbounded regulatory requirements that will only weaken the economies of both Europe and the United States,” the letter reads. “By reaching into domestic business operations, the directives serve as a direct assault on American sovereignty.”(RELATED: European Leaders Mull New Defense Reality As Trump’s Return Signals End To Unrequited Military Aid)Red State Officials’ Letter re: EU RulesbyNick Popeon ScribdSpecific policies highlighted in the letter include EU rules mandating a host of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) disclosures and broadly defining “materiality” in ways that may invite politicized interpretations of European regulators ortort litigationback in the U.S.Additionally, the state financial officials pointed to requirements for green corporate transition plans and supply chain ESG disclosures that they say will impact the domestic operations of affected U.S. companies, though they also note that they would like USTR to probe “the overall European ‘Green Deal’ and related taxes, subsidies, and directives.”“The EU directives, built on unscientific assumptions about the nature of climate change impacts and ignoring the reality that the world’s economy remains reliant on fossil fuels for the foreseeable future, will force companies to incriminate themselves,” the letter states.“Our aim is to enhance trade relations with the EU’s member states—some of our country’s strongest allies and best trading partners. The EU’s aggressive ESG agenda has crippled European own economic growth and threatens to undermine that of the United States,” the letter continues. “This is intolerable. We hope that strong action, including a Section 301 investigation, motivates the EU to reconsider its sustainability directives.”A Section 301 investigation is a tool that the USTR can use under the Trade Act of 1974 to seek recourse and relief from other countries’ violations of trade deals or actions that unreasonably hurt American commerce,accordingto the Congressional Research Service.Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, backed the financial officials’ call for an investigation into the EU’s climate directives in a Tuesday statement.“In his first month in office, President Trump has kept his promises to the American people and is eliminating the rot that is ESG and woke capitalism from our institutions. But there is more to be done, these ESG-obsessed climate cartels will not stop pushing an activist agenda on Americans until President Trump’s policies are adopted by institutions,” said Hild. “Thank you to the state financial officers who are continuing to put pressure on these EU groups who are more obsessed with climate activism than good business practices. The Trump Administration should investigate and challenge all European programs that subject American companies to radical climate goals.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

How To Forecast Growth In The Age Of Uncertainty,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/lauraclaytonmcdonnell/2025/03/04/how-to-forecast-growth-in-the-age-of-uncertainty/,"MoneyTaxesHow To Forecast Growth In The Age Of UncertaintyByLaura Clayton McDonnell, Contributor.Laura Clayton McDonnell covers tax, legal, risk & regulatory issues.Follow AuthorMar 04, 2025, 03:18pm ESTSave ArticleCommentA road sign warning of volatility ahead against a stormyTo see more road signs click on the link... [+]below:gettyIt only takes a quick scan of any cable news network to realize that we have entered a whole new age of uncertainty. For many business leaders, it may be apropos to dub it the Age of Uncertainty.Tariffs, tax cuts, energy policy, interest rates — these are just a handful of the major variables in play right now that could have a massive impact on near- and longer-term macroeconomic activity. It begs the question: How can businesses that operate in this environment hope to accurately forecast growth when the core policies that will help determine that growth are in flux?The Volatility EconomyTake tariffs, for instance, arguably the most visible sign of the changing business landscape. Today, 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canadaofficially went into effect, along with an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports, which was added to a 10% tariff introduced in February. China responded quickly with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods, and Canada announced its own plans to impose 25% tariffs on U.S. products. Furthermore, according to thelatest reports, the European Union is next in line. Although the impact of these actions will likely be significant, just how significant varies depending on whom you ask.Critics of the tariffs point to the automotive industry’s heavy reliance on factories and suppliers in Mexico, chip makers’ giant manufacturing operations in China and Mexico and the basic materials industry’s close links to Canada as big potential risks. Advocates say domestic manufacturers and companies with heavily diversified supply chains, and of course, the U.S. government, could see significant business gains following the introduction of new tariffs. It is worth noting here that in 2019, during the Trump administration’s first term, tariffs on solar panels, washing machines, steel, and aluminum brought in some$79 billion in direct revenueto the government.The conclusion to be taken from all of this is that major global trade wars do not affect all stakeholders in uniform — or even predictable — ways. The key factor separating businesses that succeed amid this type of volatility and those who are crushed under its weight is agility. Companies need to be able to see three steps ahead and around corners to develop the kinds of workarounds and course corrections that allow them to thrive in this type of fast-changing economic environment.MORE FOR YOUGoogle Starts ‘Silently’ Tracking Your Phone—How To Stop ItTrump Threatens More Tariffs Against Canada—Here’s How The New Levies Could Impact PricesGoogle’s Gmail Update—You Need A New Email AddressThe Hits Keep On ComingThe volatility doesn’t stop with tariffs. The U.S. House of Representatives’ recentpassing of the Republican’s budget resolutionshould allow them to extend the tax laws enacted under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which include $4.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years. Exactly how that will affect businesses remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: corporate tax departments will need to shift gears from the strategies they were deploying under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.Add to that the uncertainty surrounding the future of global environmental, social, and governance and sustainability reporting requirements, the international implementation of the global minimum tax, and widespread geopolitical volatility. This creates a recipe for many unknowns in corporate growth forecasts for the coming months.Predicting The UnpredictableFortunately, there are some tried and true approaches to getting out in front of these types of unpredictable policy swings — many of which were developed and refined during the first Trump administration. The first step is to develop a stress-testing mindset when forecasting future growth. The most important question corporate finance, risk and global trade professionals can ask themselves right now is: “What if?”Thankfully, today, that wildly open-ended and hard-to-quantify question can be answered with predictive analytics, global trade management, and corporate tax software that is updated in real time as regulatory and policy changes take effect. While technology has made scenario testing and data collection easy, the challenge for business leaders is now to think creatively about all of the possible scenarios that could affect their businesses.The other critical variable is flexibility. Businesses need to be ready to make big moves quickly, whether that means developing flexible supply chain models that can adapt to overnight changes in demand, supply, or market conditions or even moving key personnel and functions to different parts of the world. Big businesses have been the beneficiaries of a global economy for a long time. Now is the time to use that global reach to create flexible options for the future.Follow me onLinkedIn.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"

Notably, American and United Airlines removed DEI sections from their latest reports, while only Delta and Southwest Airlines maintained such statements, focusing on merit-based hiring. This trend is part of a larger shift in corporate America, which has seen companies like Walmart and McDonald's also scale back DEI initiatives, influenced by recent political and legal changes, including the Supreme Court's ruling on affirmative action.Trump’s Impact on TravelRead how the first 100 days of U.S. President Donald Trump’s actions and policies are shaping the future of travel, and get insights into the industry's evolving response.Read the StoriesMajor U.S. airlines are starting to dial down statements on diversity, equity and inclusion hiring policies after wide-ranging pushback from the Trump administration.In American Airlines’ 2024 10-K, the company didn’t include a section on DEI – it had DEI sections in each of the four prior years.In its 2023 annual report, American said, “Cultivating an environment that celebrates diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is a priority for us,” and listed out a range of initiatives the company had done to increase its diversity.This year, American said, “We seek to hire the best and brightest,” and made no mention of diversity.United Airlines had a similar shift. In its most recent annual report, there are no mentions of “diversity, equity and inclusion.”Last year, in the same report, United provided statistics on the percentage of women and underrepresented minorities in its workforce. The company provided similar statistics in 2022, 2021, and 2020.JetBlue also did not have any statements on DEI hiring policies in their most recent annual reports, but did include such statements in its 2023 10-Ks.“The report reflects that we have always hired based on merit and qualifications, especially as safety is critical to our airline,” JetBlue said in a statement to Skift. “We believe in the programs, practices, and policies that we’ve put in place to create a workplace where people feel valued, respected, and able to do their best work.”While Alaska Airlines did not mention DEI by name, it did say, ""We believe that all who depend on Alaska Air Group deserve respect regardless of race, ethnicity, ability, age, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. We are committed to treating every person equally – on and off our aircraft. ""Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines are the only two major U.S. carriers that included a statement on DEI in their 2024 annual reports.“Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is critical to effective human capital management at Delta,” Delta said in its 2024 10-K. The carrier also emphasized in the same report that its hiring practices were “merit-based.”Last year, the Atlanta-based carrier said one of its DEI initiatives included: “Closing diversity gaps in senior leadership positions by increasing the representation of women, Black and Latin/Hispanic groups in those roles.”This year, Delta didn’t mention closing any diversity gap in senior leadership, but instead it was “ adopting recruitment strategies that seek qualified leadership candidates with diverse experiences, skills and perspectives and expanding leadership development programs to continue promoting from within.”Southwest said in its 2024 annual report that “DEIB [diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging] is a part of the Company’s culture.”Southwest didn’t mention initiatives related to hiring more women and underrepresented minorities in the report, but had such mentions in its 2023 report.Airlines and DEIThe industry has beenslow to closeits gender and racial gaps. For example, around 80% of flight attendants are women. But only 8% are pilots, even with a significant increase in pushes to recruit more female pilots.Delta’s and United’s most recent ESG reports from 2023 say that women make up around 34% and 33% of senior roles, respectively.American, Delta, United and JetBlue also signed onto theInternational Air Transport Association’s “25 by 2025,”a pledge to increase female representation among corporate and frontline roles.DEI policies in corporate America took off in 2020 following the George Floyd protests. Many industries, including airlines, started publicly embracing diversity hiring policies.And as the industry faced an acute pilot shortage following the pandemic, airlines made major strides to recruit more women and people of color into those roles.Unitedopeneda flight school called the United Aviate Academy and covered much of the hefty costs associated with becoming a pilot. The carrier touted that 80% of its first Aviate class were either women or people of color. United also hasbusiness resource groupsfor its employees.Deltapartneredwith historically Black Hampton University as part of its collegiate pilot career path pipeline. And Alaskalauncheda partnership with Sisters in the Sky in 2019 to increase its representation of Black female pilots by 2025.DEI Becomes Contentious for AirlinesPresident Trump and allies like Elon Musk have blamed DEI hiring policies for compromising safety in the airline industry.In a post on X, Musk claimed DEI was a reason for theAlaska Airlines blowoutlast year.“Do you want to fly in an airplane where they prioritized DEI hiring over your safety?” Muskwrote on X. “That is actually happening.”TrumpblamedDEI fora fatal collisionnear Reagan National Airport, without citing any evidence. The National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating the incident.Some airline executives have also changed the way they talk about DEI, instead emphasizing that their companies hire on merit.“Well, we do hire on merit,” United CEO Scott Kirby said duringa January 22 call with analysts. “We can hire the absolute best of the best and have a naturally diverse workforce.”Delta CEO Ed Bastian told theAtlanta Journal Constitutionlast month that DEI hiring is merit-based.“We don’t have DEI initiatives.

Inside Boutique Group’s Cultural and Social Sustainability Commitments,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Skift'}",http://skift.com/2025/03/04/inside-boutique-groups-cultural-and-social-sustainability-commitments/,"HotelsInside Boutique Group’s Cultural and Social Sustainability CommitmentsSponsored ByBoutique Group+ SkiftMarch 4th, 2025 at 8:00 AM ESTSkift TakeModern sustainability in travel is no longer just about environmental initiatives. Hotel brands must also consider their impact on local communities and commitments to cultural heritage. With those pillars in mind, Boutique Group is paving the way for a new “responsible luxury” model in Saudi Arabia.— Boutique GroupShareLinkedIn iconTwitter iconfacebook iconMail iconThis sponsored content was created in collaboration with a Skift partner.As concern for sustainability grows in theMiddle East’s luxury sector, hotels across the region are prioritizing eco-friendly practices. Steps like reducing waste, conserving water, and using renewable energy sources are essential for sustainable hotels today. To take its commitments even further, Saudi hotel brand Boutique Group made sustainability part and parcel of its new approach to travel in the region, branding it as “responsible luxury.”Today’s luxury travelers aren’t just interested in sustainability — they’re also willing to pay a premium to minimize their carbon footprints and positively impact the communities they visit. According to The Vacationer’s 2023 sustainable travel survey, 82 percent of travelers said green travel is eithervery or somewhat importantto them. In its 2023 sustainable travel report, Booking.com found that 43 percent of travelers arewilling to spend more on certified sustainabletravel options.Boutique Group’s responsible luxury mindset starts with a comprehensive Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework, reflecting the modern luxury traveler’s focus on sustainability. In an effort to achieve LEED certification for all the hotels in its portfolio, the group prioritizes eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient systems, and sustainable practices aligned with global hospitality standards.However, the brand’s responsible luxury mindset also extends beyond these fundamental environmental initiatives to include other elements of sustainability, like cultural preservation and social investment.Historical Preservation and Cultural AuthenticityIntegral to Boutique Group’s responsible luxury approach is its ongoing work to preserve historical and cultural landmarks for future generations by transforming them intoultra-luxury hotels equipped with world-class amenities. Part of the group’s mandate is to ensure that new technologies and modern innovations align with the traditional cultural aspects of the destinations and heritage buildings it preserves.Boutique Group’s dedicated Culture & Heritage Department is devoted to preserving the region’s history and traditions. A team of multidisciplinary experts works to ensure every restoration project is accurate and authentic. Each palace employs historians to guide guests through the property and share the stories of the individuals who lived and stayed there. From architecture and design to culinary and wellbeing, every detail is based on meticulous research.A number of high-profile collaborations further demonstrate Boutique Group’s commitment to cultural integrity. For example, the brand collaborates with the King Abdulaziz Foundation for Research and Archives, which is dedicated to the continued preservation of Saudi Arabia’s history and legacy.“Our experiences give visitors an opportunity to explore therich cultural, historic, and geographic tapestriesof the regions our palaces call home. Aside from bringing the sights, scents, and smells of the region into our palaces, we also encourage our guests to engage in activities like cooking classes, cultural tours, and outdoor adventures. We connect guests with local operators to ensure our palaces are integrated into the surrounding communities and support their sustainable economic development,” said Christoph Mares, CEO of Boutique Group.Boutique Group also partners with the Saudi Ministry of Culture’s fashion and culinary arts commissions, ensuring Saudi designers and chefs are well represented to the world. That partnership is a two-way street — HH Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Farhan Al Saud, the Saudi Minister of Culture, is also the Chairman of the Boutique Group Board.Cultural Immersion Through Art, Food & WellbeingCulturally infused experiences help bring Boutique Group’s vision of responsible luxury to life for guests. For example, wellness offerings incorporate traditional Saudi healing methods that have never been seen in an ultra-luxury setting before. The Boutique Group team makes great strides to discover and engage with local healers and custodians of time-honored wellness practices.Saudi celebrity chef restaurants bring culinary traditions to the forefront at Boutique Group palaces, serving local delicacies and ingredients. At the same time, Michelin-starred and fine-dining concepts serve as a creative lab where emerging Saudi culinary talent can roll up their sleeves and learn new techniques from the world’s master chefs.Aesthetic activations also breathe new life into Saudi traditions. The art hanging in each palace pays homage to Saudi Arabia’s rich artistic heritage and craftsmanship. Each palace also spotlights living local artisans such as Ahmed AlFozan, a seventh-generation woodworker whose handcrafted ornate doors decorate the Red Palace.Building A Strong Future Through Social SustainabilityAlongside environmental initiatives and cultural preservation, the third pillar of Boutique Group’s responsible luxury approach is social sustainability. The brand is committed to generating economic opportunities that enhance the local community’s quality of life.“At Boutique Group, we are dedicated to maintaining the Kingdom’s heritage and culture in a sustainable manner while presenting authentic Saudi hospitality and generating economic opportunities that enhance the local community’s quality of life,” said Mares.Boutique Group collaborates with Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Tourism to support job creation and talent development in the travel sector. These efforts align withSaudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 planto welcome 100 million tourists annually (since raised to 150 million) andinvest over $1 trillionby the end of the decade. Annually, $100 million of those funds are earmarked to develop national talent in the tourism sector.In addition to hiring local talent — 85 percent of Boutique Group’s workforce is Saudi — the brand is dedicated to educating and training rising stars to meet the highest international standards. Boutique Group leadership routinely identifies promising up-and-coming talent and encourages them to participate in specialized hospitality training programs through partnerships with leading international institutions.“Boutique Group is committed to investing in the Saudi workforce and offering training and employment opportunities to young Saudis. We believe that Saudi youth are the future of this industry — this is their land and heritage, and they are its greatest ambassadors,” said Mares.As Saudi Arabia’s appeal as a tourist destination grows, Boutique Group aims to show that preservation and environmental stewardship are not just good practices — they’re critical to attracting discerning travelers and ensuring the long-term success of tourism in the region. The group’s Red Palace in Riyadh, slated to open by April 2026, exemplifies this commitment.To find out more about Boutique Group, visitboutiquegroup.comand @boutiquegroupsaThis content was created collaboratively byBoutique Groupand Skift’s branded content studio,SkiftX.ShareLinkedIn iconTwitter iconfacebook iconMail iconSponsored ByMarch 4th, 2025 at 8:00 AM ESTTags:Boutique Group,cultural tourism,responsible luxury,saudi arabia,Saudi Vision 2030,SkiftX Creative Studio,SkiftX Showcase: Hospitality,sustainability,wellnessPhoto Credit: Boutique GroupUp NextHotelsHow Data Quality Issues Impact Global Hospitality OperationsThere are wide discrepancies in data quality for hotel transactions across global regions, with the largest occurring in Asia-Pacific.

For example, $42 million was expected to go to Johns Hopkins to “research and drive ‘social and behavior change’ in Uganda.” Another $25 million was set to “‘promote biodiversity conservation and promote licit livelihoods’ by developing ‘socially responsible’ behaviors in Colombia.”Further, $40 million was set to “improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants,” and a whopping $520 million was allotted for a consultant to do what DOGE described as “ESG investments in Africa and ‘mobilize private sector resources and expertise.'”The taxpayer money that was set to be wasted overseas does not end there, as DOGE also revealed that $69 million was set to go to the Eurasia Foundation for “digital transformation activity” in Europe.Other discoveries, per DOGE’s list, include:-$32mm to Internews for programs including “media enabling democracy, inclusion, and accountability in Moldova” and the promotion of “sustainable media outlets”-$7mm for the American Bar Association to promote the “resilience” of the “Eurasian legal sector and civic society”-$45mm to “address the needs, opportunities, and challenges identified by activists and other civic actors engaged in nonviolent collective action”-$52mm for the World Economic ForumAccording to DOGE’s official website, the total estimated savingsringsin around $65 billion thus far. DOGE says this savings is a combination of what it describes as “fraud detection/deletion, contract/lease cancellations, contract/lease renegotiations, asset sales, grant cancellations, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.”The figures, currently updated twice a week, has an “agency efficiency” leaderboard showcasing which agency has led to the most total savings. As of Wednesday, the Department of Education was in first place, followed by the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The number one agency with the least total savings is the Department of State, followed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Department of Transportation (DOT).AfricaLatin AmericaPoliticsaccountabilityColombiaDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE)savingsUganda"
Consumer Trust Issues Hinder Industry Efforts to Close Protection Gap: Survey,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Carriermanagement.com'}",https://www.carriermanagement.com/news/2025/02/28/272320.htm,"Most insurance executives surveyed last year believe they have “an ethical obligation” to close the protection gap—and also believe that “lack of trust in the insurance industry” is a key barrier standing in the way.Economist Impact, a division of the Economist Group whichaims to partner with corporations, governments and nonprofits to deliver positive societal change, and SAS, a provider of data analytics and AI solutions, conducted the“Future of Insurance” surveyof more than 500 insurance executives from 17 countries in September and October 2024.Just over 78 percent agreed with the statement, “The insurance industry has an ethical obligation to close the global protection gap,” with 37.5 percent saying they “agree strongly” and 41 percent agreeing “somewhat.”While most insurance executives surveyed said they s that the insurance industry has an ethical obligation to close the global protection gap, nuances in their responses appeared from one region to the next. Only 26.5 percent of North American insurance executives “strongly agreed” with this, while 48 percent of Latin American executives said they “strongly agreed.”The term global protection gap refers to the difference between insured and uninsured losses across life, health, natural catastrophe and crop insurance. In dollars, Swiss Re Institute measured a $1.8 trillion gap for 2022, according to a 2023 report titled “Restoring resilience.” More recently, Aon and WTW separately calculated a 60 percent protection gap for losses from natural disasters globally for 2024 (2025 Climate and Catastrophe Insight, Aon, Jan. 22,2025 andWTW Natural Catastrophe Review 2024, WTW, Jan. 28, 2025)Related articles:Economic Losses From Natural Disasters Soared in the U.S. in 2024;Natural Catastrophes Insurance Protection Gap Stands at 60%: WTWInsurance executives surveyed by SAS and Economist Impact across the globe also believe that there is significant business opportunity to be found in closing the global protection gap. Just over 40 percent “agree strongly” that this is the case and 35.7 percent somewhat agree.They face barriers to closing the gap, however, they also agree.Insurance executives regard the following as top barriers that “significantly/very much” limit their organization’s ability to address the global protection gap:Franklin Manchester, Principal Global Insurance Advisor at SAS, highlighted the trust issue that topped the list with 76.5 percent citing waning consumer trust as a key factor. “It’s no wonder why,” he said. “As carriers retreat from disaster-prone areas and data privacy violations are revealed, insurers must act decisively to regain consumer and regulator confidence,” he said in a media statement.“Full data transparency and investment inresponsible innovationwould be a significant step forward to reputation and brand reform—one of the top three outcomes the surveyed execs report could come from closing the protection gap,” he said.For P/C insurance executives surveyed, other positive outcomes of closing the protection gap ranked in the top three were a diversified investment portfolio and more diversification of insurance products. Across all insurance sectors, executives also saw increased insurance profits as a potential beneficial outcome (tied for third-place with product diversification).More Report ThemesResults for the“Future of Insurance” surveyare summarized in a report titled, “Revealing the paths to 2040: a global industry survey report.” Complementing the report, SAS has created an interactivedata dashboard, allowing views of results by region, country and insurance industry sector.Experts from The World Economic Forum, The Geneva Association, Economist Impact and SAS will explore the research in depthin a webinar on March 6.While executives answered many questions about the protection gap, climate change and ESG initiatives, the broad focus of the report was to identify significant trends poised to shape the industry in the coming decade, strategies insurers are pursuing to stay ahead of these trends and potential roadblocks.Aggregate survey results across all regions and all sectors of the insurance industry show that executives ranked “changing market dynamics”—specifically, the entry of new competitors and industry consolidation—and “the rise and spread of AI and generative AI,” far and away, as the top two trends most likely to influence the industry. Forty-eight percent selected changing market dynamics out of a list of a dozen potentially impactful trends, and 42 percent selected AI.While most of the other trends, like increasing cybersecurity risks and increasing data privacy regulations, garnered 25-30 percent of the selections, the next most popular selection was the pressure to prioritize ESG principles—selected by 39 percent of respondents.In another section of the survey, 80 percent of respondents said they believe other industries have made more progress on ESG commitments than insurers.Given the timing of the collection of survey responses—before the U.S. elections last year—Carrier Management couldn’t help but wonder whether some results might be different were the survey conducted again today. As President Trump ushers in a new era of deregulation in the U.S., with less focus on climate, DEI and other initiatives, and theEU retreats from some planned ESG regulations, do insurance industry executives still see an ethical responsibility to close the protection gap? Is there still the same impetus to follow through on ESG commitments?While there isn’t another study in the works right now, Manchester offered some thoughts via email.As carriers retreat from disaster-prone areas and data privacy violations are revealed, insurers must act decisively to regain consumer and regulator confidence.”Franklin Manchester, SAS“The environmental, social and governance three-legged stool has a branding problem, and it’s often used interchangeably with ‘climate,’ ‘sustainability’ and ‘resiliency.’ Valid concerns have been raised about large organizations (and nations) exiting climate accords and commitments in recent weeks, but we must acknowledge that insurers, by definition, have a stake in the environment, social issues and governance,” he said.“They are companies with mission and value statements, with reputations to manage, and with foundations that drive positive change.”In addition, he said that “all technologies (not only AI) must be governed—not only to support regulation but also because capital matters and solvency requirements are real. Technology run amok can bankrupt a carrier faster than you can say ‘inconvenient truth,'” he said. (Editor’s Note: “An Inconvenient Truth was a 2006 documentary about former U.S. Vice President Al Gore’s campaign to educate people about global warming.)Manchester also noted that investments in ESG pay off for insurers and society, referring toa recent studyfinding that every $1 invested in resiliency reduces damage and cleanup by $6, and economic loss by $7: a return of 13-to-1.Related article:Investing in Climate Resilience Really Pays Off: StudyTech Strategies and Outcomes: What About Talent?Surveyed executives were asked to identify the avenues they believe would help their organizations most effectively target the global protection gap. Three of the most popular methods involve technology:Using technologies to make insurance products more affordable (48 percent); 40 percent of the respondents’ organizations are currently deploying.Developing innovative insurance products like parametric or microinsurance (42 percent); currently in action at 40 percent of respondents’ organizations.Leveraging data to better assess risks and design products (39 percent); 32 percent of the respondents’ organizations are working on.Turning the focus inward, much of the survey focused on technology investments and other strategies that insurance executives have been pursuing, or expect to move on in the near future in order to take advantage of broader trends and achieve desired outcomes.“What are the most important outcomes for your organization to achieve through efforts to stay ahead or take advantage of these trends?”Forty-six percent of the executives answering this question selected “minimizing underwriting and operational costs” as a target outcome. No other targeted outcome was close. Ranking second, selected by one-third of executives, was “market expansion.”Which of the following strategies have been, or do you expect to be, most effective for your organization to stay ahead or take advantage of these trends?Here, “optimize actuarial processes” was the clear frontrunner, selected by 43 percent of executives. Increased use of data for decision-making ranked behind that (35 percent).Only 27 percent of executives said they believe closing the skills gap would be among the most effective strategies to employ to take advantage of emerging trends, and just 28 percent will prioritize “talent management” in the next three-to-five years. And in terms of targeted outcomes, “improved employee retention and satisfaction” ranked ninth out of a dozen possibilities, selected by one-quarter of the surveyed executives as a desired outcome.These results surprised Manchester.“The industry is barreling towards a talent crisis. We’re seeing data on the silver tsunami of outgoing talent—and a lack of interest from potential up-and-comers—cited in the U.S., as well as in Europe and Asia-Pacific. This is a crisis in the making,” he said.“Keeping talent is hard and a lack of talent spells disaster. We can water down concern about AI stealing jobs from humans in insurance when reckoning with the fact that AI can supplement the work of what underwriters, adjusters, or agents do.” But the reverse isn’t true, he said, referencing an idea from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: “‘AI won’t steal your job. Someone who’s an expert with AI will.'”Said Manchester: “Insurers need to understand that people are their greatest asset. Hiring good ones, training them well, giving them the tools they need to be successful and providing clear, regular feedback on their performance is part of a successful business strategy.”Beyond talent initiatives and setting ESG goals, the executives were asked to indicate whether they have already implemented or expect to implement 11 specific strategies—ranging from cybersecurity investments to setting up agile organizational structures—in the next three-to-five years.The most likely strategies to be have been implemented already were agile organizational structures (43 percent), diversifying distribution channels (42 percent), and optimizing actuarial processes (40 percent).Sixty-four percent of insurers have not invested in cybersecurity nor established transparent guidelines for collection, use and storage of data."

Now, right-wing parties and populist movements are sweeping to power across the globe, toppling the entrenched left-wing establishment and its ESG-supporting, DEI-promoting, AGW-fearing, 2SLGBTQ+-rainbow-flag-waving orthodoxy.But now that the pendulum is clearly swinging toward the right, what are these “populist politicians” and “anti-establishment radicals” actually accomplishing? Are we seeing a real revolution, or just more of the same?Well, let’s take a look at how the populist slogans compare to reality, shall we?Globalism is out! . . . But suddenly the self-same people who were protesting the encroaching North American Union 20 years ago are now itsmost fervent cheerleaders, andthe old globalist dreamof an EU army isfinallybecoming areality.Technocracy is kaput! . . . But suddenly the people who were decrying AI, technocracy and the Big Tech censors are the loudest supporters of Peter Thiel, Larry Ellison,Palmer Luckey, Elon Musk and the rest of the gaggle of PayPal Mafia / Thielverse / government contractors / NSA enthusiasts andnext-gen AI-weapons system manufacturers.War is over! . . .

But President Musk is performing a great reset and DOGE is rebuilding trust in government!So, what’s happening here? Why is it that the DEI window dressing is being taken down but the agenda is marching on as usual?Is the pendulum an illusion?

Unfortunately, that agenda could be undermined by judges who pursue politics instead of calling balls and strikes from the bench.That’s what Texas District Court Judge Reed O’Connor did when he ruled that American Airlines violated its fiduciary duty by including BlackRock-managed funds in its 401(k) plan, given the asset manager’s broader corporate engagement with environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. While many conservatives oppose ESG, this case had nothing to do with it because no such funds were involved in American’s decision. O’Connor’s ruling assumes American Airlines is guilty because it dared associate with a company that has practices O’Connor doesn’t like.This means that businesses can be penalized not just for their direct actions but for the perceived intentions or broader activities of their partners and service providers. This could lead to increased litigation risk and uncertainty for all businesses because the ruling seems to depart from legal and financial prudence, undercutting established investment practices and the ability for employers to sponsor retirement plans with the best fund choices for their employees’ needs.Furthermore, the ruling inadvertently undermines American’s workforce efforts to prepare for a financially secure retirement. The decision casts doubt on the ability to use low-cost index funds and other popular types of funds in 401(k) plans, potentially limiting the options available to plan fiduciaries in seeking the best returns for retirees. This affects not only large corporations like American Airlines but also small businesses that manage their retirement plans under the same legal principles.Looking at the macroeconomic picture, reigniting the American economy hinges on the stability and growth of business. Businesses are the backbone of our economy, responsible for employment and innovation. And 401(k)s are essential to Americans’ financial security. Yet, rulings like this could stifle their recovery and growth by creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty around investment and partnership decisions. Imagine if no one had access to a 401(k) at work because of the liability it puts on employers.The reality is that O’Connor’s ruling ignores the myriad investor protections already in federal law and regulation, including those that stem from the fiduciary duty requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Policymakers and the legal community must consider the broader economic effects of judges, regardless of their preferred politics. Conservatives should question why O’Connor put his politics ahead of a consistent, predictable regulatory environment that will unleash economic growth and opportunity. Our future prosperity depends on it.Mike Feuz is an economist and a research associate for Free the People/InsideSourcesShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Most PopularMost PopularBoston Mayor Wu spending $650,000 to prep, $8,500 on staffers all for today’s DC sanctuary city hearingBoston Mayor Wu spending $650,000 to prep, $8,500 on staffers all for today's DC sanctuary city hearingAyanna Pressley walks out of Trump address to Congress, Trump calls Warren ‘Pocahontas’Ayanna Pressley walks out of Trump address to Congress, Trump calls Warren 'Pocahontas'Dominican man living in Massachusetts busted for allegedly dealing fentanyl from Sinaloa CartelDominican man living in Massachusetts busted for allegedly dealing fentanyl from Sinaloa CartelMassachusetts congressman accuses Republicans of fundraising off sanctuary city hearingMassachusetts congressman accuses Republicans of fundraising off sanctuary city hearingHowie Carr: Questions DC pols should toss at Mayor WuHowie Carr: Questions DC pols should toss at Mayor WuJayson Tatum among three Celtics starters ruled out vs. Trail BlazersJayson Tatum among three Celtics starters ruled out vs. Trail BlazersSorry Boston!

Fact-Checking Trump Lies About the USAID “Consultant” Who Was Paid $520 Million,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Dianeravitch.net'}",https://dianeravitch.net/2025/03/03/fact-checking-trump-lies-about-the-usaid-consultant-who-was-paid-520-million/,"Glenn Kessler is a professional fact-checker at The Washington Post. I hope Jeff Bezos doesn’t fire him because he does a great job documenting Trump’s lies.This is a story in which Trump berates a programlaunched during his own first term! Trump started the program he now mocks as ridiculous!Kessler begins:“Here are some of the flagrant scams that, as an example, they’ve spent money on … $520 million for a consultant … you know, when I hired consultants, and they just take advantage of you, it’s a horrible thing to watch. I give them $25,000. I feel I’m overpaying. These guys got $520 million [for] environmental, social governance and investments in Africa.”— President Donald Trump,in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Feb. 22“$520 million was given for a consultant to do ESG. That’s environmental, social and governance investments in Africa, $520 million.”— Trump,remarks to governors at the White House, Feb. 21“Here are just some of the things that we’ve paid, and we’ve stopped, and we’ve gotten the money back: $520 million for a consultant to do ESG, that’s environmental, social and governance investments in Africa.”Kessler cites more of the many times Trump has made an example of this “consultant” who was given a $520 million contract.But here’s the truth, that is, the fact-based truth:Almost daily lately, President Donald Trump complains about what he claims is an egregious contract that the U.S. Agency for International Development gave to “a consultant” for work in Africa — $520 million for what he calls “environmental, social and governance.”Sometimes he might mention investments, but not always. And sometimes he riffs about the outrageous fee this consultant received, compared with the $25,000 or $50,000 in fees he would dole out to consultants when he was in business. Once, he described it as “an environmental study.”We’ve debunked many claims the White House has made about USAID funding, from condoms for Gaza (not true) to a transgender opera in Colombia (also not true). But this is an especially glaring error — the money was directed toward supporting a program launched in the first Trump presidency.The FactsFirst of all, while Trump suggests that the $520 million contract has been terminated and “we’ve gotten the money back,” not even the website for the U.S. DOGE Service — the organization overseen by billionaire Elon Musk to carry out government firings and spending cuts — makes this claim. While the DOGE website lists a $520 million contract with DAI Global, it pegs the value recovered as about $159 million.Meanwhile, the USA Spending website says DAI Global has received $128 million in outlays and $361 million has been obligated.In other words, much of the contract has already been awarded, so Trump can’t brag about getting back $520 million.The contract is with DAI Global, a global development company founded in 1970 with 350 people at its headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, plus staff at a dozen offices around the world. According to its website, DAI implements “programs funded by international donors, national governments, private corporations, or major philanthropies.” (DAI declined to comment.)A White House official defended the president’s use of the phrase “a consultant” because DAI, among its many services, provides social sector and nonprofit consulting. But that’s just a small part of its business.As for the $520 million contract, it established something called the Prosper Africa Trade and Investment Activity. “The purpose of this Activity is to mobilize enterprise-driven solutions that increase trade and investment in Africa, including North and sub-Saharan Africa,” the contract language said. “It will strengthen Africa’s markets by developing new trade and investment relationships, particularly between the U.S. and Africa.”Prosper Africa, ironically, was launched in 2019, during Trump’s first term.“Prosper Africa is a Trump Administration initiative intended to foster U.S.-African trade and commercial ties,” according to the Congressional Research Service. “The initiative seeks to double U.S.-Africa trade, spur U.S. and African economic growth, and — as U.S. officials have stated — ‘demonstrate the superior value proposition of transparent markets and private enterprise for driving growth.’” The idea was to harmonize the existing programs of 16 U.S. agencies and departments in a cohesive, coordinated manner to promote sales and investment by American companies — as a way to counter China’s growing influence in Africa.“The President is criticizing the contract, not necessarily Prosper Africa,” the White House official said.So how does a program designed to bolster a first-term Trump initiative get twisted into something negative (ESG!) and worthy of termination? Through some creative cherry-picking.The White House official noted that DAI, on its website, uses words such as “social” and “governance.” For instance, “We tackle fundamental social and economic development problems caused by inefficient markets, ineffective governance, and instability. … We are committed to shaping a more livable world.”None of that, of course, is part of the contract, which is focused on investment.The official also pointed to a DAI blog post that mentioned that “inadequate access to reliable electricity remains a critical constraint to the social and economic growth prospects of 580 million people in Africa,” providing an investment opportunity for U.S. businesses, particularly exports of U.S. clean technologies. The project would “increase U.S. clean energy exports to Africa and close at least $350 million worth of cleantech energy deals by 2026,” the blog post said.As far as we could tell, clean energy is only a piece of the Prosper Africa Trade and Investment Activity — and, in any case, the goal was to boost American business.We should note that earlier this month, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast (R-Florida) described the contract as “$520 million to pay consultants to teach people in Africa about climate change” — which is also wrong. His staff did not respond to repeated requests for comment.The Pinocchio TestTrump’s claim is based on a series of misunderstandings.• $520 million is not being saved.• The contract is not with a consultant, but a company that, among its many services, offers some consulting.• The contract was to promote investment and American business, under a program started by Trump.• Social and governance activities are not in the contract, though (horror!) it would promote sales of U.S. clean energy exports.Trump earns Four Pinocchios.Diane Ravitch's BlogFacebookEmailLinkedInMoreTwitterBlueskyLikeLoading..."

"AM Best Concerned D&O Prices ‘Fell Too Far, Too Quickly’","{'id': None, 'name': 'Insurance Journal'}",https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2025/03/03/813972.htm,"AM Best Concerned D&O Prices ‘Fell Too Far, Too Quickly’March 3, 2025Email ThisSubscribe to NewsletterArticle0 CommentsInsurance industry rating analysts from AM Best warn recent softer pricing for directors and officers coverage could begin to affect insurers’ underwriting results.AM Best noted renewal premium for monoline D&O liability continued to fall during the first three months of 2025, particularly for companies involved in initial public offerings, special purpose acquisition companies, and de-SPAC companies. For many public companies, significant price decreases of the last several years may begin to reverse.This may be a good thing, said AM Best, considering adverse development is embedded in prior-year losses and defense and cost containment (DCC) expense reserves.“Despite recently favorable statutory underwriting results, the softer pricing of the past couple of years could ultimately dampen the financial performance of D&O insurers because the premium base to support future claims activity has diminished, even as risks are emerging and expanding,” AM Best said in arecent commentary.The number of securities class-action lawsuits in federal and state courts have risen; the impacts of social inflation and third-party litigation financing continue; and lawsuits regarding artificial intelligence (AI) – including “AI washing” – have surfaced.There are other emerging concerns, such as policy changes with respect to DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion), ESG (environmental, social and governance) and regulations, the rating agency said.As of the end of the third quarter 2024, direct monoline D&O premium declined for 10 straight quarters following a period in 2020 and 2021 of significant premium increases to address loss trends. Since then, new capacity from new entrants in the market looking for good returns in a high-rate environment, eventually resulted in pricing declines.AM Best said, “Accident year results over the near term may indicate that premiums fell too far, too quickly.”The rating agency said it will reassess pricing and loss reserve trends when data from 2024 has been aggregated and analyzed.TopicsPricing TrendsAM BestWas this article valuable?YesNoThank you!

Final check for BoT board chair in April,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Bangkok Post'}",https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/2973048/final-check-for-bot-board-chair-in-april,"BusinessGeneralFinal check for Bank of Thailand board chair in AprilPUBLISHED : 5 Mar 2025 at 05:18NEWSPAPER SECTION:BusinessWRITER:Nareerat Wiriyapong and Wichit ChantanusornsiriSmallMediumLarge2Listen to this articlePlayPauseMr Somchai is the likely nominee of the committee.The Finance Ministry expects to complete the final qualifications check for the new chairman of the Bank of Thailand board in April before forwarding his name to the cabinet for appointment.The board chairman selection committee recently notified the ministry it nominated Somchai Sujjapongse, a former finance permanent secretary, according to a ministry official who requested anonymity.The official said the ministry expects no problems with Mr Somchai's qualifications.The law requires state agencies to recheck Mr Somchai's qualifications to see whether he was previously involved in legal complaints or declared bankrupt, said Lavaron Sangsnit, finance permanent secretary.The state agencies conducting the inspection include the Royal Thai Police Office and the Office of the National Anti-Corruption Commission.Satit Limpongpan, chairman of the selection committee, previously refused to disclose the nomination. Pundits expect Mr Somchai to be appointed as the new chair of the central bank's board.Mr Somchai, 64, is a highly regarded Thai economist and civil servant with extensive experience in the financial sector. Born in 1961, he holds a bachelor's degree in economics from Chulalongkorn University and both a master's degree and a PhD in economics from Ohio State University in the US.The government is setting up another committee to select a new central bank governor to succeed Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput, whose term expires in September.The Finance Ministry is working on this selection process and the appointment of the new board chairman simultaneously, said Mr Lavaron.Kuala Lumpur-based Maybank said naming Mr Somchai as the new central bank board chair could strengthen policy coordination.""The news that the post will reportedly go to the government's nominee Mr Somchai is likely to improve investor confidence. It raises the likelihood of closer coordination with fiscal policymakers,"" Maybank said in a research note co-written by director of macro research Erica Tay.Mr Somchai was nominated by the Finance Ministry after its previous choice of Kittiratt Na-Ranong was blocked.The note predicted the appointment will support last week's policy interest rate cut of 25 basis points, which eases the financial burden of the industrial sector.""Manufacturing activity is expected to stabilise at a pace of 1-2% growth this year. The rate cut to 2.00%, its second in the central bank's cycle, will relieve the financial burden for industry somewhat,"" said Maybank.""Yet structural issues will require deft policy coordination between the central bank and government. With elevated uncertainty surrounding US President Donald Trump's threat of reciprocal tariffs, the authorities may need to prepare more stimulus to respond to adverse scenarios,"" noted the research.Meanwhile, analysts said the transfer of matured long-term equity funds (LTFs) to new Thai ESG funds should reduce selling pressure on the Thai bourse.Viriya Lappromrattana, senior executive vice-president of I V Global Securities, said transferring matured LTFs worth 188 billion baht to the new Thai ESG fund should ease investors' fears and curb LTF redemption, lifting the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) from less than 1,200 points.The Thai bourse has lost 200 points or 15% this year, twice the dip in the Philippine and Indonesian stock markets, she saidThe Finance Ministry plans to allow transfers of LTFs to Thai ESG Fund X, with a maximum tax exemption of 500,000 baht, up from the Thai ESG fund exemption limit of 200,000 baht.KEYWORDSThailandFinance MinistryNew BoT board chairmanSomchai SujjapongseDo you like the content of this article?COMMENT(2)"

EU Green Deal: A Growth Strategy for New Economic and Business Models,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Hospitality Net'}",https://www.hospitalitynet.org/opinion/4126041.html,"OpinionEnvironment & SustainabilityEU Green Deal: A Growth Strategy for New Economic and Business ModelsThe EU Green Deal and Hospitality industry: Challenges, Opportunities, and the Road AheadByMelinda   RatkaiDr. Professor of Hospitality Business27 February 2025EU Green Deal: A Growth Strategy for New Economic and Business Models — Photo byPhoto by Alex Bertha on Unsplash, Bordeaux, FranceThe tourism and hospitality industry is particularly vulnerable to climate change, energy transitions, and environmental degradation—existential threats to Europe and the world. To tackle these challenges, the European Green Deal aims to transform the EU into a modern, resource-efficient, and competitive economy, ensuring:No net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050Economic growth decoupled from resource useNo person and no place left behindOn 11 December 2019, the European Commission unveiled the European Green Deal as a growth strategy. But what does that mean? A growth strategy is more than just a vision or mission statement; it’s a roadmap backed by strong political will to drive meaningful transitions. And let’s be honest—these transitions are long overdue. Sometimes, it’s astounding to reflect on how humanity allowed such environmental degradation, driven by egoism and convenience, with little regard for future generations.Commitments and ChallengesAll 27 EU Member States have committed to making the EU the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. This involves reducing emissions by at least 55% by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels). If this sounds familiar, it’s likely because many firms, including those in hospitality, are already measuring and reporting their CO2 emissions and other sustainability metrics.However, the picture remains complex, especially for the hospitality sector. This industry straddles real estate and services, encompassing diverse operations like food and catering, accommodation, and wellness. These activities are both human- and resource-intensive, making sustainability efforts crucial. Yet, ensuring that every department and employee understands their responsibilities and contributions is not a small task. Managers and executives often get bogged down in daily operations, which can overshadow broader strategic goals.Overcoming OverwhelmThe EU Green Deal is expansive, comprising over 150 directives and regulations across 11 areas (see Figure 1). Some of the key points:Standardisation for Sustainability/ESG ReportingStandardised frameworks enhance transparency and comparability, enabling investors to redirect capital towards cleaner companies and sectors. The green transition requires significant investment, and governments alone cannot fund it.Global InfluenceMany EU regulations extend their impact beyond Europe, affecting non-EU competitors. Sustainability regulations are proliferating worldwide, reflecting a shared global priority.Economic CompetitivenessWhile implementing these changes may incur costs and short-term difficulties, they also address long-term competitiveness by fostering innovation, resilience, and more ESG-friendly solutions.Despite these complexities, everyone in the hospitality sector needs to embrace new business models, decision-making processes, and reporting requirements. Without collective industry participation, the green transition won’t succeed. The “No person and no place left behind” principle underscores the need for inclusivity in this transformation.Hotelschool The Hagueoffers two master’s programmes to prepare professionals for these challenges: aMaster's in Leading Hotel Transformation(MA) and an MBA inInternational Hospitality Management. These programmes focus on digital transformation and the circular economy, equipping students with the skills to navigate and lead in a rapidly evolving industry.Figure 1: European Green Deal Interpreted by Circulaw https://www.circulaw.nl/eu-wetgeving— Source: by CirculawFeel free to reach out if you want to learn more about the EU Green Deal.

Trump may have less to do with bank's net zero exit than meets the eye,"{'id': 'abc-news-au', 'name': 'ABC News (AU)'}",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-05/macquarie-exists-net-zero-banking-alliance/104946242,"analysisTrump's election has changed the world of climate finance as Australian bank quits net zero allianceBy climate reporterJo LauderTopic:Climate ChangeTue 4 MarTuesday 4 MarchTue 4 Mar 2025 at 7:20pmMacquarie Bank has become the first Australian bank to pull out of the global Net Zero Banking Alliance.(AAP: Dan Himbrechts)abc.net.au/news/macquarie-exists-net-zero-banking-alliance/104946242Link copiedShareSharearticleIn the wake of Donald Trump's election, Macquarie Bank has become the first Australian bank to pull out of a global initiative supporting banks to reach net zero, but the reasons are more complicated than a straight rejection of climate action.Macquarie's decision came after America's biggest banks withdrew from the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) ahead of Trump's inauguration as US president. A number of Canadian banks also followed suit.In recent years, Republican politicians have been on a warpath against companies that factor climate change into their business decisions and future plans, in what they described as ""woke"" green capitalism.On face value, these exits are a significant blow to the world's efforts to reduce carbon pollution and cut fossil fuels.But there is more to Macquarie's exit than meets the eye.With record amounts of money flowing into the energy transition and the costs of climate change mounting, banks are increasingly caught between short-term fossil fuel profits, and a strategy that avoids long-term exposure to climate risks and cashes in on the renewables boom.Net zero under attackThe NZBA was established in 2021 around the time of the Glasgow climate conference among a number of net-zero alliances in the finance industry.Trump 2.0 targets climate actionPhoto showsA projection on buildings shows an outline of Donald Trump's hair being blown by a wind turbine, with the words FUTURE VS TRUMPPresident Donald Trump has wasted no time dismantling climate policies and promising a new era of fossil-fuel dominance, withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement on his first day back in office.The aim of these alliances was to help their members transition their investments in line with the Paris Agreement.Under the NZBA, members had to set targets for how they would bring down emissions in their lending and investment portfolios; however, the targets weren't binding.Melbourne Law School's Rebekkah Markey-Towler researches the intersection of financial and climate change regulation.She described net zero goals as an important ""north star"" for financial organisations, but said it also made business sense to start aligning their long-term decisions with the Paris Agreement.""Longer term that is where the money is going to be made, in terms of financing how we're going to be dealing with climate change, so it is an opportunity for them,""she said.Net zero goals are just one branch of Enviromental, Social and Governance policies, known as ESG. These consider factors like climate change, diversity, or slavery in a company's decisions and investments.The business world's ESG movement sparked a culture war against ""woke capitalism"", mostly in the US, but with its impact rippling beyond.Opponents of these net zero alliances claimed that the policies ""boycotting"" fossil fuels worked against the principles of a free market and were tantamount to cartel behaviour.A multi-billion-dollar backlash to net zero followed.Some US states have banned their entities from investing in firms considered hostile to fossil fuels, and Texas pulled $US8.5 billion ($13.7 million) from the world's largest asset manager, Blackrock.And last year, 11 states sued the world's biggest three asset managers under anti-trust laws.Climate alliances started to collapseunder the political and legal attacks.The Net Zero Banking Alliance was formed around the time COP 26 was held in Glasgow in 2021.(Supplied: UNFCCC)A few years after the net zero fanfare at Glasgow, the sustained attacks against the financial world's climate shift have hit hard. The net zero alliances covering asset managers, insurers and now banks have all lost members and some have folded, promising to reform and return.Ahead of Trump's January inauguration, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo all withdrew from the NZBA.Big US banks knew where the wind was blowing and left the banking alliance.(Chris Hondros: AFP)Announcing its exit last month, Macquarie said the principles of its net zero strategy ""continue to guide activity as our climate strategy evolves to meet the needs of our clients and the requirements of governments and regulators, which differ across markets.""""The Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) helped develop global frameworks and assisted member banks as they established their initial decarbonisation plans. With those building blocks now in place, like many peers, Macquarie will no longer be a member of NZBA,"" its statement read.How useful were these alliances?Criticism of these climate alliances has come from both sides.For the climate community, its biggest criticism has been if they actually result in any reduction in fossil fuel investments or if they are just a veneer of climate concern covering business-as-usual.Jacco Minnaar, an executive at European ethical bank Triodos, took aim at the net zero alliance for allowing member banks to invest in fossil fuels, which drive climate change.Ethical banking executive Jacco Minnaar criticised the Net Zero Banking Alliance for allowing members to continue investing in fossil fuels.(Supplied: Triodos Investment Management)JP Morgan Chase had been a member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance whenit invested $US40.8 billion in 2023 into fossil fuels.Similarly, Macquarie Bank had still been investing in companies with oil and gas expansion plans while it was an NZBA member,according to research from energy analyst think tank IEEFA.""In financing practice, there is hardly any difference between banks that are members of a climate alliance and those that are not,"" Minnaar wrote.His response also highlights how different climate sentiments are in the US compared to Europe, where the green transition is widely accepted and supported in the finance world.A hall pass for fossil fuels?Donald Trump's return to the White House hasn't just raised the spectre of a net-zero witch hunt, it's also potentially changed the direction of the US economy.Ultimately, banks have an obligation to follow the trends of the market and make money for their shareholders.Why Trump will struggle to halt progress on climate changePhoto showsA composite image of Donald Trump and solar panels.Donald Trump's promise to unpick climate policy could be at his peril.At the time of the Glasgow climate conference, green investments were the rage, says Gordon Noble, a research director with the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) who focuses on sustainable finance.""When there were commitments being made around net zero … there was a lot of economic opportunity to do so. In the US, there was the Inflation Reduction Act, there was big money being thrown at effectively incentivising investment into green technology and renewable energy,"" he explained.Now, Trump's ""drill baby drill"" mantra is more than just a slogan;he has also signed executive orders to boost the fossil fuel industry.It's not just Trump with his fingers on the scales. Vladamir Putin's invasion of Ukraine caused global coal and gas prices to skyrocket, leading to short-term profits in fossil fuels and putting financial institutions at odds with their green horizons.Russia has already reduced gas supply to Europe, and it's pushing prices up.(Reuters: Denis Sinyakov, file photo)""If your country was heading towards net zero and it's now heading towards drill, baby, drill, if you're a financial institution, your paramount duty is to your shareholders. That's the way the corporation is set up, you are responsible to your shareholders to make a financial profit,"" Melbourne Law School's Markey-Towler said of the US.""That's the direction that money is travelling at the moment. It's very short term, isn't it?""That's what ESG initiatives were meant to factor in, according to UTS's Gordon Noble, especially for long-term investors like superannuation funds.""The whole argument around ESG from a financial materiality perspective is that issues like climate change are going to play out in your portfolio,"" he said.""You might get a short-term play on fossil fuels and benefit, but in the long term, you're going to be exposed to potentially what we call stranded assets, a carbon collapse of values in assets.""For example, an investment in a fossil fuel project scheduled to operate for 30 years might close early and at a loss.Short term, banks believe money is to be made in fossil fuels.(ABC News)Caught in this theoretical long- or short-term play of the financial world are the world's trillions of dollars and the destructive heating of the planet.What does this mean for Australia?To bring it back home, the reality in Australia is very different.Being part of a net-zero group does not breach competition laws, as Australia's watchdog made clear in its new guidelines for financial institutions on sustainability and climate action.Instead there is a lot of scrutiny on greenwashing. ASIC, the country's financial agency, has been acting on greenwashing incidents as part of its role to regulate misleading and deceptive conduct in the financial industry.Australia's corporate world is also entering a new era with climate disclosure laws that kick off in the new financial year.Why does this matter? Well, large businesses and corporations will now have to report on what climate action they're taking, what climate goals they have, if any, as well as their emissions and risks relating to climate.Anna Skarbek, CEO of Climateworks Centre, says climate transition plans are becoming standard practice in business.(Supplied: Climateworks Centre)Anna Skarbek, CEO of the Climateworks Centre, an independent not-for-profit within Monash University, says this reporting is in line with international standards.""Climate transition plans are becoming a standard part of business and investment.""Nearly half of the world's privately managed money has pledged to align with the science-based net zero goals in the Paris Agreement,""she said.""Ambitions for this remain strong. We have the tools we need to solve this, now it is just a matter of how fast we can get there.""UTS's Gordon Noble believes these new reporting standards will bring a new era of transparency around what corporations are actually doing on climate change.""The challenge will be for those organisations that wish to have their cake and eat it. They wish to have renewable energy investments; they acknowledge that climate change is serious, but also they're going to finance fossil fuels,"" he said.""This world of transparency is going to really expose that.""Facing our climate futureDespite the instability, investments in clean technology in 2024 were expected to set a new record and double that of fossil fuels. At the same time, banks are increasingly exposed to the impact of hotter temperatures and more extreme weather on their portfolios.It's too early to say whether the retreat of America's wealthiest banks, and one of Australia's, will result in a new gold rush for fossil fuels, or if it's a discreet attempt to avoid the net-zero backlash.As ethical banking executive Jacco Minnaar writes, ""This is not the time to lose hope.""""Their departure is distressing because it reduces our scope for action, but it also provides an opportunity for a strong 'coalition of the willing' to take the NZBA forward and show what climate action really looks like.""PostedTue 4 Mar 2025 at 7:20pmTuesday 4 Mar 2025 at 7:20pmTue 4 Mar 2025 at 7:20pm,updatedYesterday at 5:46amWed 5 Mar 2025 at 5:46amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesMoving erratically: Cyclone Alfred landfall now pushed into Saturday morningLIVEPhoto showsA huge wave splashes up against a beach side buildingIs Cyclone Alfred spending longer at sea good news or bad?Topic:ExplainerPhoto showsA woman stands and watches huge waves crash on the shore of a beachAs Cyclone Alfred approaches his electorate, Dutton quietly attends a Sydney political fundraiserBAnalysis by Brett WorthingtonPhoto showsPeter Dutton speaks outside the Queensland emergency services complexResidents fear repeat of devastating 2022 floods as cyclone loomsTopic:CyclonesPhoto showsA flooded buildingPM leaves door open to calling election in days after cycloneTopic:Federal GovernmentPhoto showsAlbanese stands at a lectern, a digital weather map behind him.Related stories'The writing's on the wall': Australia's largest mortgage lender sets the tone after ditching climate culpritsTopic:BankingPhoto showsA Commonwealth Bank branch in Melbourne's CBDWhich super funds are the biggest investors in fossil fuels?

            ISTThe revised BIT framework must correct shortcomings without overly diluting India’s regulatory autonomy.(Pixabay)SummaryOur model Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) of 2015 has fared poorly and is currently up for revision. It should be redrafted to boost inflows of foreign direct investment without compromising sovereignty.Gift this articleThis is a Mint Premium article gifted to you.Subscribe to enjoy similar stories.Subscribe nowThe Indian budget announcement of a revamped modelBilateral Investment Treaty (BIT)to make it moreinvestor-friendlyis a delayed acknowledgement of the framework having failed to achieve its core objectives.Since its adoption in 2015, India has signed agreements with only five countries—Belarus (2018), Kyrgyzstan (2019), Brazil (2020), the UAE (2024) and Uzbekistan (2024), highlighting challenges in securing BITs with key trade partners and attractingforeign direct investment (FDI)flows.Annual FDI inflows have only marginally increased from $60.2 billion in 2016-17 to $70.9 billion in 2023-24, reflecting global economic uncertainties and India’s restrictive investment treaty framework. Investors often cite legal unpredictability and cumbersome dispute settlement provisions as deterrents.The revamp presents an opportunity not just to tweak the treaty’s text, but to re-conceptualize India’s engagement with global investors to restore their confidence and enhance inflows.Also Read:BITs shouldn’t bite: Time to rework India’s approach to bilateral investment treatiesAttracting foreign investment in an era of geopolitical fragmentation and restructured global supply chains requires a fine balance between investment protection and regulatory autonomy.India’s model BIT, drafted in reaction to a spate of adverse international arbitration rulings (Cairn Energy, Vodafone, etc) is excessively cautious. Its mandatory five-year exhaustion of local remedies before international arbitration, restrictive definition of investment and omission of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause had made it unpalatable to foreign investors.The revised BIT framework must correct these shortcomings without overly diluting India’s regulatory autonomy.First, the clause on five-year local remedies must be streamlined. While domestic dispute resolution is essential, a protracted wait exacerbates investor uncertainty when a judicial backlog is a major concern. A fork-in-the-road (FITR) clause, which ensures investors make a definitive choice between domestic courts and arbitration, or a shorter exhaustion period could lift investor confidence without domestic legal institutions being undermined.Second, the definition of ‘investment’ should align with global best practices, shifting from a rigid enterprise-based approach to a broader asset-based one that recognizes intangible assets, portfolio investments and digital transactions. India’s exclusion of such assets in its model BIT limits its ability to attract investments in technology and services, where capital mobility is high.Also Read:India can get foreign investment without dispute-settlement treaty giveawaysThird, the exclusion of MFN provisions should be re-assessed. While India rightly seeks to prevent investors from cherry-picking favourable terms from other treaties (or ‘treaty shopping’), a well-defined MFN clause—allowing investors equal substantive protections but not procedural benefits—could boost investor confidence without exposing India to unintended legal risks. India’s global competitors, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, provide MFN treatment, which is non-discriminatory and thus serves to enhance their investment attractiveness.Fourth, the Investment-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) mechanism should be recalibrated. The BIT’s restrictions on tribunal jurisdiction, particularly its avoidance of the ‘Fair and Equitable Treatment’ (FET) standard, have been a sticking point in negotiations. While broad and vague FET provisions expose states to excessive litigation, a well-defined FET clause—mirroring those in European Union BITs—can provide a balanced mechanism to protect investors against arbitrary state action without cramping India’s regulatory space.Fifth, to align foreign investments with India’s sustainable development goals, BITs should incorporate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) obligations. The EU-Canada treaty and Morocco-Nigeria BIT show how investor commitments to environmental protection, labour rights and corporate responsibility can be embedded.However, overly stringent ESG provisions can deter investors, particularly in emerging markets, by raising compliance costs and regulatory burdens. A calibrated approach that aligns with global standards while retaining flexibility for local economic contexts is thus needed.Also Read:Critics of ESG investing should take a closer look at the conceptLastly, institutional stability is key. India’s abrupt termination of 77 BITs in 2016 created policy uncertainty. While recalibration is necessary, policy consistency is equally important. Any new BIT framework must not only be investment-friendly, but also signal India’s stable and predictable approach to international economic engagement. The proposed revamp should go by transparent stakeholder consultations.India’s evolving investment treaty framework needs to embody both economic pragmatism and sovereign resilience. But we mustn’t go back to the pre-2016 status. We need a forward-looking strategy that attracts investors while preserving India’s regulatory autonomy. If executed well, this reform could raise India’s credibility, deepen its integration with global value chains and fast-track the economy’s rise. India has an opportunity to adopt a BIT framework that aligns with international best practices in the interest of sustained FDI inflows and GDP growth.These are the authors’ personal views.The authors are, respectively, a Supreme Court lawyer specializing in international dispute resolution and partner at Seven Seas Partners; and an assistant professor of economics at IIM Ranchi.Gift this articleCatch all theBusiness News,Market News,Breaking NewsEvents andLatest NewsUpdates on Live Mint.

Passive investing is about simplicity; dont give into active fund management lurking in the garb of thematic passive funds,"{'id': 'the-times-of-india', 'name': 'The Times of India'}",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest/passive-investing-is-about-simplicity-dont-give-into-active-fund-management-lurking-in-the-garb-of-thematic-passive-funds/articleshow/118641938.cms,"Getty ImagesIn passive investing, investors delegate the decision-making to the fund manager. However, many AMCs are now coming out with multiple passive mutual funds that actually require active participation and management on part of investors.Dhirendra KumarCEO, Value ResearchThere’s a curious charade playing out in theIndian mutual fund industry, one that turns the very concept ofpassive investingon its head. Fund houses have discovered a convenient loophole in Sebi’s regulatory framework and are enthusiastically exploiting it.Sebi sensibly limits AMCs to launching just one actively managed fund in each plain category. This prevents the proliferation of near-identical products and reduces investor confusion. One large-cap fund, one mid-cap fund, and so on. It’s a straightforward approach that benefits everyone. Except that there’s a catch. This limitation doesn’t apply to passive funds. If there’s an index, a fund based on it can be launched. Therein lies the opportunity that fund houses have pounced upon—commission custom indices and launch ‘passive’ funds tracking them.The result? An absurd multiplication of indices. The National Stock Exchange now offers at least 120 equity indices, while the Bombay Stock Exchange has at least 64. While not all are created specifically for fund houses, they are readily available for AMCs. We now have indices with names like ‘Alpha Quality Value Low Volatility 30’, ‘EV & New Age Automotive’, ‘ESG’, ‘Enhanced ESG’, and my personal favourite, ‘ESG Sector Leaders’. This isn’t innovation; it’s simply clutter masquerading as choice.Let’s be clear about what’s happening. These aren’t genuine passive funds in the spirit of the concept. True passive investing is about simplicity, capturing the overall market return without attempting to outperform it. When you invest in a Nifty index fund or a Sensex fund, you buy the market, and are not making a specific bet on which segment will outperform. However, these ‘passive’ funds require very active decisions from investors. Should you invest in a banking index fund or a healthcare one? An ESG index or a momentum index? Suddenly, you are making precisely the kind of allocation decisions you were trying to avoid by choosingmutual fundsin the first place.The entire point of investing in a mutual fund is to outsource these decisions to professionals. You pay a fund manager to determine which sectors are attractive, which themes have potential, and which stocks represent good value. When you select a thematic ‘passive’ fund, you are effectively taking back that responsibility while still paying for professional management. It’s worth remembering why passive investing gained popularity in the first place. Research shows that most active managers failed to beat broad market indices over the long term. However, the solution wasn’t to create hundreds of narrow indices, but simply to track the broad market cheaply.Artificial Intelligence(AI)Java Programming with ChatGPT: Learn using Generative AIBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)Basics of Generative AI: Unveiling Tomorrows InnovationsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)Generative AI for Dynamic Java Web Applications with ChatGPTBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramMarketingPerformance Marketing for eCommerce BrandsBy - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara MarketersView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)Mastering C++ Fundamentals with Generative AI: A Hands-OnBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramFinanceA2Z Of MoneyBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)Master in Python Language Quickly Using the ChatGPT Open AIBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramOffice ProductivityZero to Hero in Microsoft Excel: Complete Excel guide 2024By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)AI and Analytics based Business StrategyBy - Tanusree De, Managing Director- Accenture Technology Lead, Trustworthy AI Center of Excellence: ATCIView ProgramTechnologyCertified Jenkins ProfessionalBy - Vskills, India's Leading Certification BodyView ProgramAstrologyVastu Shastra CourseBy - Sachenkumar Rai, Vastu ShashtriView ProgramData ScienceSQL for Data Science along with Data Analytics and Data VisualizationBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramWeb DevelopmentA Comprehensive ASP.NET Core MVC 6 Project Guide for 2024By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramOffice ProductivityMastering Microsoft Office: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 365By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramMarketingDigital marketing - Wordpress Website DevelopmentBy - Shraddha Somani, Digital Marketing Trainer, Consultant, Strategiest and Subject Matter expertView ProgramWeb DevelopmentMastering Full Stack Development: From Frontend to Backend ExcellenceBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramFinanceFinancial Literacy i.e Lets Crack the Billionaire CodeBy - CA Rahul Gupta, CA with 10+ years of experience and Accounting EducatorView ProgramLeadershipBusiness Storytelling MasterclassBy - Ameen Haque, Founder of StorywallahsView ProgramMarketingFuture of Marketing & Branding MasterclassBy - Dr. David Aaker, Professor Emeritus at the Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, Author | Speaker | Thought Leader | Branding ConsultantView ProgramStrategyESG and Business Sustainability StrategyBy - Vipul Arora, Partner, ESG & Climate Solutions at Sattva Consulting Author I Speaker I Thought LeaderView ProgramWe are witnessingactive managementin disguise: fund houses creating bespoke indices that reflect particular investment viewpoints, then labelling the resulting products as ‘passive’. This gives them two advantages: they can launch multiple funds in the otherwise restricted categories and promote new funds, which are always easier to sell than the existing ones.However, the consequences for investors are less beneficial. The proliferation of these quasi-passive funds adds to the overwhelming array of investment options. It places the burden of sectoral and thematic allocation squarely on their shoulders, a task that requires expertise, time, and a deep understanding of the markets. Moreover, these narrowly focusedindex fundsoften carry higherexpense ratiosthan the true, broad market index funds, eroding one of the key benefits of passive investing—low costs.The solution? Return to first principles. If you choose passive investing, embrace its genuine philosophy: broad market exposure, minimal costs and simplicity. Combining one or two broad market index funds will serve most investors better than a collection of narrowthematic funds. If you want exposure to specific sectors or themes, consider whether a well-managed, diversified active fund serves that purpose. At least you are explicitly paying for the manager’s expertise to shift allocations as market conditions change.In investing, as in many areas of life, simplicity often trumps complexity. When ‘passive’ becomes this active, it’s time to step back and question what we are really paying for.The Author is CEO, VALUE RESEARCH(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

As enterprises race to deploy ever-larger AI models, the power demands of hyperscale data centers have surged. In 2023, data centers accounted for 4.4% of total U.S. electricity consumption, a figure that could rise to between 6.7% and 12% by 2028, according to a recentDOE report.Lenovo AI ServersWith AI’s computational intensity skyrocketing, Goldman Sachs estimates that data center electricity usage coulddouble by 2030. For instance, Google’s AI infrastructure now consumes enough power to rival entire mid-sized cities, prompting the company toexplore nuclear solutions.Last Energy’s Microreactors: A Scalable Power Solution for AI Data CentersAs the power grid struggles to keep pace with AI-driven demand, Last Energy has announced plans to deploy 30 microreactors in Texas specifically to power data centers (Last Energy). The reactors will be built on a 200-acre site in Haskell County, Texas, with Last Energy filing for grid connection approval from ERCOT. The company is also preparing an Early Site Permit application with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a critical step toward commercial deployment.Rendering of Last Energy’s Northwest Texas ProjectLast Energy’s PWR-20 microreactors (20 MWe) are designed for modular manufacturing, meaning they can be built off-site and rapidly deployed to meet power needs. The company has built two full-scale prototypes in Texas anddemonstrated its designto industry and government officials.“Texas is America’s undisputed energy leader, but skyrocketing population growth and data center development is forcing policymakers, customers, and energy providers to embrace new technologies,” said Bret Kugelmass, Founder and CEO of Last Energy. “Nuclear power is the most effective way to meet Texas’ demand, but our solution — plug-and-play microreactors, designed for scalability and siting flexibility — is the best way to meet it quickly. Texas is a state that recognizes energy is a precondition for prosperity, and Last Energy is excited to contribute to that mission.”Why Microreactors? A Long-Term Solution for AI InfrastructureUnlike conventional large nuclear plants, microreactors offer a decentralized, flexible, and zero-emission power source, making them ideal for AI and high-performance computing (HPC) environments. The U.S. government and private companies have increasingly turned to microreactors to ensure energy resilience, with projects like:TerraPower & Sabey Data Centers: Exploring using Natrium microreactors to power data centers in Texas and the Rocky Mountain region (DataCenter Dynamics).Google’s Nuclear Investments: Partnering with Oklo and Holtec to integrate small modular reactors (SMRs) into data center infrastructure (AP News).Microreactors offer a compelling solution for AI-driven power growth because they:Generate consistent, high-density power without requiring vast land or fuel logistics.Reduce carbon emissions, making them attractive for ESG and sustainability initiatives.Bypass traditional grid limitations, ensuring power availability even in constrained regions.The Future: Can Microreactors Reshape AI Infrastructure?The traditional energy grid will struggle to sustain data center expansion with AI models consuming increasingly demanding power levels. Microreactors and nuclear energy, generally, could shift the balance, offering dedicated, low-carbon, high-efficiency power tailored for hyperscale computing.If Last Energy’s 30-reactor deployment in Texas proves successful, similar micro-nuclear projects could emerge across Europe, Silicon Valley, Northern Virginia, and other AI hotspots, where power grid limitations already pose a risk to future data center growth.Last EnergyEngage with StorageReviewNewsletter|YouTube| PodcastiTunes/Spotify|Instagram|Twitter|TikTok|RSS Feed0FacebookTwitterPinterestEmailBrian BeelerBrian is located in Cincinnati, Ohio and is the chief analyst and President of StorageReview.com.previous postLenovo ThinkEdge SE100: Compact AI Inferencing for the Modern Edge"

Harrison.ai used the X-rays to train its AI without patients’ knowledge or express consent. I-MED is also an investor in harrison.ai.Related Article Block PlaceholderArticle ID: 1177947Emergency room patients’ scans used to train AI without their knowledge, documents suggestCam WilsonCrikey’sinvestigations — which also uncovered how this data included chest X-rays from the public healthcare system and frompatients in emergency situationswho could not consent to their scans being used — prompted inquiries from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner into I-MED. Harrison.ai has defended itself, saying it has abided by Australian laws and regulations and that how I-MED has handled this matter is outside its purview.At estimates, Greens Senator David Shoebridge, the party’s digital rights spokesperson, questioned how the NRFC investigated the potential risks associated with its harrison.ai investment.NRFC chief investment officer Dr Mary Manning said the corporation had considered concerns raised in these investigations before deciding to invest in harrison.ai, a decision made “shortly” before it was officially announced on January 29.“We did look at ESG [environmental, social and governance] … including data privacy and patient data and we are comfortable,” she said.Know something about harrison.ai?

He also said the NRFC had an ongoing role in managing investments in companies.The NRFC also took a question on notice about harrison.ai’s use of Stanford data to train its models that are listed as for non-commercial use only.The federal government’s investment was part of harrison.ai’s $170 million fundraising round, its third so far.Minister of Industry and Science Ed Husic welcomed the investment: “This is what we want to see more of — brilliant Aussie know-how creating thriving world-beating businesses,” he said at thetime.Have something to say about this article?

DSL’s suite of products includes the following: digninexESG: is an accredited Hong Kong Monetary Authority award winning cloud based ESG platform that offers end to end reporting from topic discovery, data collection to collaborative report publishing. Our diginexESG platform is ISO-27001 Certified (an international standard to manage information security), official partner of Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), World Economic Forum and signatory of the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment (UN PRI). The diginexESG platform guides companies through the entire ESG journey; from materiality assessment & stakeholder engagement, framework & indicator selection, the data collection and collaboration process, report creation, validation and ultimately report publishing. By leveraging machine learning and data analytics, diginexESG is able to drive material efficiencies in the reporting process, and the blockchain-enabled audit trail, whereby a record of each data activity is created and stored on a blockchain, provides greater transparency in the data thus increasing its value. Originally targeted specially at Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) around the world who are new to ESG reporting and lack the budget or bandwidth to engage with traditional and often expensive consultants, diginexESG has increased its feature set to include functionality that also targets larger companies with more complex organizational structures. diginexESG has also been adopted by global commercial banks like HSBC to help engage with their diverse customer base at scale. diginexLUMEN: allows companies to execute comprehensive supply chain risk assessments about working conditions within the supply chain. Supplier information is validated against worker feedback and automated risk calculations enables companies to prioritize issues for mitigation and prevention of adverse impacts and improvement efforts. diginexLUMEN focuses on broad data collection through complex inter-jurisdictional supply chains with a specific focus on social governance issues such as forced labor due diligence, gender risk and child labor risk. Through the collection of data from suppliers and validation by workers, diginexLUMEN relies on proprietary algorithms to generate risk scores to help companies identify which parts of their supply chain require greater scrutiny. The platform then auto-generates corrective action plans which allow the brands and suppliers to work together to remedy potentially problematic areas and reduce the risk score. diginexAPPRISE: is a multilingual application that collects standardized, actionable data related to working conditions directly from workers in global supply chains. Through tailored question sets, companies can deploy surveys directly to workers in their supply chain on a variety of topics such as responsible recruitment, gender equality and pulse check living and working conditions. The worker voice tool was initially developed by the United Nations University Institute in Macau (UNU-IIST) in partnership with The Mekong Club – an organization working with the private sector to bring about sustainable practices against modern slavery, and was acquired by DSL on December 14, 2021. diginexAPPRISE is available both as a standalone tool and also fully integrated into diginexLUMEN. diginexCLIMATE: is a proprietary carbon footprint calculator based on the GHG protocols that is currently available as an integrated part of the diginexESG platform. This allows companies to seamlessly calculate their Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon footprint as part of their overall ESG reporting journey. Scope 1 are those direct emissions that are owned or controlled by a company, whereas scopes 2 and 3 indirect emissions are the result of the activities of the company but occur from sources not owned or controlled by it. DSL also offers the following complementary services: diginexADVISORY: is a service offered by DSL as a complement to the suite of DSL software license sales. diginexADVISORY provides clients strategy and advisory support at every stage of the sustainability journey, including assurance solutions for credible reporting.

WWF Launches Fund To Make Leather Supply Chains More Forest-Friendly,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiehailstone/2025/03/05/wwf-launches-fund-to-make-leather-supply-chains-more-forest-friendly/,"InnovationSustainabilityWWF Launches Fund To Make Leather Supply Chains More Forest-FriendlyByJamie Hailstone, Contributor.Jamie Hailstone is a U.K-based reporter, who covers sustainability.Follow AuthorMar 05, 2025, 05:36am ESTSave ArticleCommentAn officer of the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) takes...

Justice Minister Flavio Dino said authorities estimate at least 15,000 people have illegally invaded the protected Amazon rainforest reservation, where Indigenous leaders accuse gold miners of raping and killing inhabitants, poisoning their water with mercury and triggering a food crisis by destroying the forest. (Photo by ALAN CHAVES / AFP) (Photo by ALAN CHAVES/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty ImagesThe World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has launched a new fund to improve the sustainability of leather supply chains and protect tropical forests.TheDeforestation-Free Leather Fundwill invest in projects to improve the traceability and resilience of leather supply chains.It will also enable companies to deliver their deforestation-free commitments, send strong market signals to cattle ranchers, beef producers, and leather producers, and contribute to more sustainable leather production.The projects will initially include operations in Brazil, with the possibility of expanding to other beef-producing countries in South America in the near future.The fund will also support farm-level investments to promote the supply of deforestation-and conversion-free leather and assist farmers and ranchers to formalize operations, rehabilitate degraded farmland, and establish pathways for continuous improvement.The WWF said the fund also aims to support the ear-tagging and individual traceability of 1 million head of cattle in the first three years of activity, promoting the recovery of 45,000 hectares (111,200 acres) of degraded land in the same period.The WWF’s senior director for beef and leather supply chains, Fernando Bellese, said “deforestation is still out there” and still very relevant, during an online press conference.Bellese said tropical forests are an important carbon sink and help fight climate change, but there are still high deforestation rates in some parts of the world, including South America.MORE FOR YOUTrump Speech Interruption: Rep.

One is, step forward and step up before you think you might be ready.… Becoming a CEO or C-suite can be one way that you progress, but you can also just become really deeply knowledgeable in a particular area.… Sometimes as women and just as humans, we can maybe hold ourselves back. So, I would say, step up before you’re ready.…(S)upport appears when once I’ve taken the step….""The other thing is stay open to serendipity…We may forget that serendipity is sometimes how the opportunities that we get to step into are shown to us…. So, stay open.”Kate Williamson Electric Ladies PodcastMake decisions despite incomplete information – ask deeper questionsBjork Kristjansdottir, Carbon Recycling InternationalBjork Kristjansdottir“My advice is first, like it’s around decisions.

Many of us get into these roles, and I think it's important to break those stereotypes, whether by increasing your professional education or getting reskilled or upskilled, and to be able to do what you really want to do.”“You really need to push yourself to get out of your comfort zone, because that's what gives you growth. That's what, you know, really opens your mind to other opportunities. Every woman has within her the potential to break the boundaries. And I think these boundaries are there to be broken. “Gauri Singhon Electric Ladies PodcastWhat problem are you solving?

And that is what we have to recognize. We have so much to offer, and half this battle is just us opening our mouths and letting it out.”“Really be listening to people who are in, in your field. And, also quite frankly, know that there will be moments when not everything is going to be perfect, right? And there will be compromise. And that's okay. But as long as you're not at a point where you're feeling like, you've just sold your soul to somebody…But I think being realistic and practical about what you can get done, again.”Majora Carteron Electric Ladies PodcastThis Women’s History Month we can harness our courage and strength – and this career advice – and know that we have a strong community of women who are thriving, and that hundreds of companies value their female talent (and customers, investors and suppliers).

"Conspiracy Theorists Were Right About Everything, by Brandon Smith","{'id': None, 'name': 'Activistpost.com'}",https://www.activistpost.com/conspiracy-theorists-were-right-about-everything-by-brandon-smith/,"February 27, 2025Conspiracy Theorists Were Right About Everything, by Brandon SmithEditorActivismBrandon Smith,Survival BlogFor many years alternative economists and “conspiracy theorists” have argued that, according to the evidence, there has been an organized criminal cabal operating a long-running agenda to exploit and eventually destroy western culture. We have suggested that much of this agenda was being funded with our own tax dollar while using government institutions and NGOs as vehicles for social engineering.In the 20 years since I started work in the liberty movement (or patriot movement), I have seen corruption beyond imagining and it all culminated in 2020-2023 when many of us battled against the imposition of total medical tyranny and mass woke indoctrination. Even after that startling Orwellian period we were still called conspiracy theorists, but public awareness is changing rapidly.I’ve seen enough to know that what is happening today is truly unprecedented. We have entered a crossroads; a time when reality is no longer discarded for the sake of collective comfort and “conspiracy” becomes historic fact. It’s an exciting time to be alive, but also potentially hazardous.My running theory has always been that once the house of cards came crashing down and the truth was revealed to the wider public, a whole lot of skeptics that used to call us “fringe crazies” and “tinfoil hatters” would suddenly claim they “saw it coming all along”. Yes, the conspiracy theorists were right, abouteverything. The truth is coming to light in a big way, but what does this mean for the future?Can America Handle The Truth?The recent dismantling of USAID and the open investigations into numerous federal agencies has opened a Pandora’s Box; the covert funding that these institutions are involved in (including millions in pay-offs to various news media outlets and propaganda platforms) is, I believe, just the tip of a massive iceberg that could very well sink the US system faster than the Titanic.Elon Musk’s DOGE group has only just begun dipping their toes into the dark waters of the Treasury, Medicaid, Social Security, and the Defense Department. We all know there are some horrifying monsters lurking in those depths. This doesn’t even take into account the hidden activities of the controllers of the Federal Reserve.The establishment media argues that USAID represents only 1% of the total federal budget, as if that makes the budget waste acceptable. But if there is that much mismanagement and gerrymandering in a smaller organization like USAID, imagine how much fraud there is in the rest of the federal government?Over the years many of us in alternative economics have wondered if our nation would be able to handle the revelation that almost everything about our system is fake. Half the country has suspected as much, but what would happen if we had hard proof – A smoking gun?USAID is that smoking gun, the proof of death, but it’s only one of many buried bodies that are about to be uncovered. The real revelations will come when DOGE discovers how much US policy is directed and controlled by entitiesoutsideof our own country.What happens when they investigate the numerous financial and political networks connected to the WEF, Davos, World Bank, the IMF, the BIS, and international think tanks like the CFR, Tavistock, the Atlantic Council, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, and Open Society Foundations? What about the investment influences of Black Rock, Vanguard, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, etc.?When the globalist hand behind the revolving door of cash is revealed, when the shadow government becomes a concrete and undeniable fact, is the public going freak out?The political left is an enemy of freedom and morality, yes, but the greater issue is that they are a useful tool for more powerful elitist interests. It’s a cartel, an oligarchy working together to bring down the west from within and replace it with something new. A new ideology and a new economy that would effectively turn the majority of the population into unwitting serfs.Only four years ago the WEF was boasting about the coming of the “4thIndustrial Revolution”, the rise of the “cashless society”, the “Fifteen Minute City” and the “Sharing Economy”. And, as we now know, many of those projects were being paid for with our tax dollars. The globalists were so convinced that they had the populace dead to rights. They thought they had won.It was only through the tireless efforts of liberty movement activists and conservatives around the world that the plan was disrupted and the globalists were sent into retreat. However, the fight is far from over. There are some important problems that need to be addressed as we enter the era of transparency. Here’s what will probably happen next…Rabid Sabotage By The Political LeftThe government is effectively being audited by the Trump Administration, and the Democrats are enraged. Why? Because they (and a handful of Neo-Cons) know full well what that audit is going to find. Activist judges and progressive politicians are going to obstruct and interfere with the process as much as they can. Their entire power structure depends on the steady embezzlement of tax dollars and the constant churning of the fiat printing press.For those people who don’t understand what the big deal is with USAID, I suggest they research ESG programs and what they do. USAID was basically a vehicle for global ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance; a meaningless acronym designed to hide a program for global socialism) and it was spending incredible sums of money to spread woke propaganda into every facet of our society.Leftist legal actions won’t make much difference in the long run, but they’ll still try to delay. These delays will be used to buy time for media spin. They’re going full force to misrepresent DOGE as some kind of totalitarian entity “destroying democracy”, however, authoritarians have never and will never pursue government transparency; this is not a thing.  Authoritariansalwayspursue obscurity and occult secrecy around their activities. The leftists, by their own actions, are exposed as the true totalitarians.Democrats and establishment NGOs will continue trying to foment civil unrest and they will use woke dupes as cannon fodder in this fight. Anything to distract the public from the evidence of their criminality.  Violence and terrorism should be expected.Economic Downturn Is Inevitable – Trump Will Be BlamedBroad budget cuts are essential to saving the economy in the long term, but they are also a double-edged sword in the short term. For example, US GDP stats rely greatly on government spending in their calculations (they shouldn’t, but they do). Government spending accounts for around 36% of our nation’s GDP – It’s a methodology used in recent decades to make our economic health look stronger than it really is.As Trump executes extensive cuts to government spending, this will in turn make it look as if GDP is plummeting. Leftists will claim that Trump’s policies are crashing the financial system.On top of this,I’ve been warning for some timethat the Biden Administration has been engaging in complex data manipulation. Now that Biden is gone the real data is already coming out and it’s not good. Inflation numbers and employment numbers from the Biden era are being “adjusted”, as I predicted, showing a much weaker economy than originally reported. Retail stats and GDP are next.The American public will need a crash course in how the economy works and who is behind the downturn, or the leftist media will have a field day with the revised stats.Can The Investment World Handle The Truth?When the level of fraud within the US system is fully exposed, will the investment world panic? Will they pull their money out of US markets that have long been supported artificially by government funds and central bank intervention? These are valid questions we need to consider. The truth needs to come out regardless; nothing can be fixed until the source of the rot is uncovered. That said, the mantra “ignorance is bliss” is one that America has been living by for a long time.I think Americans are desperate for the truth and desperate for reform, but change on the scale we are facing always brings chaos with it. I suggest that conservatives and patriots prepare accordingly.Cutting Ties With Globalist-Run GovernmentsAs the process of transparency moves forward in the US we have to take into account that Europe, the UK, Australia, and Canada are all still well under the hypnosis of the cabal. Things are changing overseas; the UK, Germany, and France are starting to see conservative movements blossom, but globalists are determined to stop them from gaining political traction.I suspect we will see strained or broken ties with many former allies in the coming years as they crack down on their own citizens and show their true authoritarian colors. We’re already seeing this happening in the UK, Germany, France, and Romania among others.The Most Dangerous Time Is When You Think You Are WinningEstablishment elites are like vampires. In fact, I suspect the whole mythology of vampires from centuries ago is actually based on the very real and evil crimes of the elites of the past. They use their wealth and influence to gain a foothold in your country, city, or village. They use subterfuge to gain trust and exert authority. They spread darkness and corruption like a cancer, then they feed on the population at will while pretending to be benevolent leaders.But these parasites must be invited in by the people. The public has to, in some ways, give consent to their own victimization. We have to willfully ignore their activities; our apathy is seen as consent. Sunlight is the primary remedy and the vampires flee when it’s unleashed. Finally, if all else fails a stake through the heart is required to end them. It could be a proverbial stake, or a very real one.Audits of the corrupt system are the sunlight. Independent patriot rebellion is the stake through the heart if all else fails.Just because the evil is exposed does not necessarily mean that it will stop or disappear. Often these cornered creatures fight even harder and their mission is to take you down with them. Great truth often precedes the darkest of days and the collapse of epochs. As the shadow government faces uncertainty for perhaps the first time ever, who knows how the leviathan will react?—About The Author:Brandon Smith is a frequent guest contributor to SurvivalBlog.

DSL’s suite of products includes the following: digninexESG: is an accredited Hong Kong Monetary Authority award winning cloud based ESG platform that offers end to end reporting from topic discovery, data collection to collaborative report publishing. Our diginexESG platform is ISO-27001 Certified (an international standard to manage information security), official partner of Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), World Economic Forum and signatory of the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment (UN PRI). The diginexESG platform guides companies through the entire ESG journey; from materiality assessment & stakeholder engagement, framework & indicator selection, the data collection and collaboration process, report creation, validation and ultimately report publishing. By leveraging machine learning and data analytics, diginexESG is able to drive material efficiencies in the reporting process, and the blockchain-enabled audit trail, whereby a record of each data activity is created and stored on a blockchain, provides greater transparency in the data thus increasing its value. Originally targeted specially at Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) around the world who are new to ESG reporting and lack the budget or bandwidth to engage with traditional and often expensive consultants, diginexESG has increased its feature set to include functionality that also targets larger companies with more complex organizational structures. diginexESG has also been adopted by global commercial banks like HSBC to help engage with their diverse customer base at scale. diginexLUMEN: allows companies to execute comprehensive supply chain risk assessments about working conditions within the supply chain. Supplier information is validated against worker feedback and automated risk calculations enables companies to prioritize issues for mitigation and prevention of adverse impacts and improvement efforts. diginexLUMEN focuses on broad data collection through complex inter-jurisdictional supply chains with a specific focus on social governance issues such as forced labor due diligence, gender risk and child labor risk. Through the collection of data from suppliers and validation by workers, diginexLUMEN relies on proprietary algorithms to generate risk scores to help companies identify which parts of their supply chain require greater scrutiny. The platform then auto-generates corrective action plans which allow the brands and suppliers to work together to remedy potentially problematic areas and reduce the risk score. diginexAPPRISE: is a multilingual application that collects standardized, actionable data related to working conditions directly from workers in global supply chains. Through tailored question sets, companies can deploy surveys directly to workers in their supply chain on a variety of topics such as responsible recruitment, gender equality and pulse check living and working conditions. The worker voice tool was initially developed by the United Nations University Institute in Macau (UNU-IIST) in partnership with The Mekong Club – an organization working with the private sector to bring about sustainable practices against modern slavery, and was acquired by DSL on December 14, 2021. diginexAPPRISE is available both as a standalone tool and also fully integrated into diginexLUMEN. diginexCLIMATE: is a proprietary carbon footprint calculator based on the GHG protocols that is currently available as an integrated part of the diginexESG platform. This allows companies to seamlessly calculate their Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon footprint as part of their overall ESG reporting journey. Scope 1 are those direct emissions that are owned or controlled by a company, whereas scopes 2 and 3 indirect emissions are the result of the activities of the company but occur from sources not owned or controlled by it.

Florida SBA Files Complaint Against Target for LGBT Pride Campaign,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Ai-cio.com'}",https://www.ai-cio.com/news/florida-sba-files-complaint-against-target-for-lgbt-pride-campaign/,"Home>News>Pensions>Florida SBA Files Complaint Against Target for LGBT Pride CampaignPensionsFebruary 27, 2025Florida SBA Files Complaint Against Target for LGBT Pride CampaignThe state pension manager accuses the retailer of exposing itself to losses for its ‘ESG and DEI’ initiatives.ByMatt ToledoThe Florida State Board of Administration, the fiduciary manager of the state’s pension and investment funds, filed a complaint against the Target Corp., accusing the retail giant of misleading and defrauding investors by not informing investors of the risks associated with customer backlash to a 2023 “Pride” campaign, as well as other environmental, social and governance and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.The complaint,State Board of Administration of Florida v. Target Corp., filed February 20 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, argues that boycotts related to the company’s 2023 Pride campaign wiped $25 billion off of the company’s market capitalization over a six-month period, including $10 billion in a mere 10 days.The Florida SBA manages a portfolio of $257 billion, including the state retirement system and a hurricane disaster fund.The complaint, which seeks class action status and demands a trial by jury, aims to represent Target investors who owned the company’s shares during the period of March 9, 2022—the day after Target released its 2021 annual report—and August 16, 2023. SBA held 787,694 shares of Target on March 8, one day before the class period began, according to the SBA’s filing.In Target’s 2022 annual report, released March 8, 2023, the company removed language that suggested that a position on or a lack of position on ESG and DEI matters could harm its reputation. The language was present in its 2021 report.Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier saidin a statementthat failing to disclose these risks was a violation of Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.The complaint hones in on the alleged deception.“Target’s CEO Brian Cornell and its Board of Directors did not oversee or disclose the obvious risks of Target’s 2023 LGBT-Pride Campaign and the ESG/DEI initiatives which it advanced, but they told investors that they did,” the complaint states. “In doing so, they deceived Target investors as to the true nature of the risks of their investments and caused them to unknowingly support Target’s Board and management in their misuse of investor funds to serve its divisive political and social goals—and ultimately cost investors billions.”Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis said in a statement that he feels the Target campaign was part of a trend.“We’ve seen time and time again that when companies prioritize performative virtue signaling and wokeness over profitability, they alienate customers, lose market value, and erode shareholder trust—all while pretending their activism carries no financial risk,” Patronis said.In January,Target announcedthat the company would step back from its ESG and DEI initiatives. Target was also sued by another Florida pension fund:in January,the City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund filed suit against the company for similar reasons.“It’s unacceptable and Florida is fighting back on behalf of taxpayers and investors that have had enough,” Patronis said in the statement. “Businesses like Target need to focus on the bottom line and do right by their customers, not some ESG overlords. Thank you to Governor DeSantis and the SBA for leaning forward on this issue.”Related Stories:Michigan Pension Fund Files Complaint Against ZoomInfoTarget Faces Another Lawsuit Related to ESG, DEI ‘Risks’Final Settlement Hearing Set for December in Class Action vs. UberTags:Florida State Board of Administration,James Uthmeier,Jimmy Patronis,SBA,Target«CDPQ Assets Grow to $328B With 9.4% ReturnMost PopularIs the Shine Coming Off of Private Credit’s ‘Golden Age’?With Interest Rates Elevated, It’s Time for Fixed IncomeWeathering the Storm: Investment Solutions for Climate ResilienceIndependent Schools Increasingly Using Outsourced CIO ProvidersHow Big Is OCIO Market?

"When Others Retreat, Innovate: Climate Action in Times of Uncertainty","{'id': None, 'name': 'Environmental Defense Fund'}",https://business.edf.org/insights/when-others-retreat-innovate-climate-action-in-times-of-uncertainty/,"When Others Retreat, Innovate: Climate Action in Times of UncertaintyPublished: February 27, 2025 byDaniel HillClimate Policy LeadershipCorporate sustainability is in a recession.CEOs areavoiding terms like “ESG”or actively speaking out against it, while some companies arescaling back sustainability pledgesorexiting voluntary net zero alliances. Concerns are also growing over the stagnation of federal climate policy in the U.S., weakening international climate agreements, and aslowdown in climate tech investmentand financing. But if they are not talking about it, is corporate sustainability no longer important to business?While corporate sustainability might be publicly facing a downturn, the reality of climate change is only intensifying. And in turn, the impact on business will only intensify. How companies choose to respond in this moment of quiet will be critical for business resilience and competitiveness.Innovation in Times of UncertaintyDuring periods of economic uncertainty or market volatility, companies often default to caution: layoffs, hiring freezes, and shelving new initiatives as capital liquidity becomes scarce or the coffers need to be shored up.But history shows that those who are strategic in their investments in innovation during challenging times often emerge as leaders. Investing in forward-thinking ideas, experimenting with business models built for the future, and adapting offerings can drive long-term success. When the economy rebounds, these investments often translate into significant competitive advantages.Consider the Great Financial Recession of 2008: Netflix doubled down on its streaming service, Mailchimp introduced a freemium business model, and Domino’s revamped its pizza recipe. In hindsight, these moves seem like obvious successes. Yet at the time, they were bold, risky investments in innovation when many peers were scaling back.While streaming, freemium and pizza may not sound much like climate action, they have one key element in common: strategic foresight. They saw how conditions were changing and adapted to those changes and ultimately, added business value. In other words, they innovated.There are few forces that will drive more change and risk to business than climate change. Making climate innovation inseparable from corporate innovation.While some companies choose to retreat, it’s the companies that integrate climate innovation into their core business strategies that will adapt quickly and remain competitive. The question is what strategic investments – adaptations and innovations – can companies leverage through climate action to gain value?Climate Innovation is Corporate InnovationA common misconception is that climate innovation equates to climate tech. Many believe the only way to innovate is by developing or investing in breakthrough technologies.However, as with corporate innovation during past economic downturns, successful climate innovation often comes from sustained, incremental changes aligned with a company’s core business context—not just disruptive, short-term solutions.Innovation, at its core, is about creative problem-solving. For corporate climate innovation, this means leveraging existing resources and practices to uncover business value through climate action. These opportunities can arise in areas like operations, offerings, investments, advocacy, and employee engagement.The companies that will thrive during this “corporate sustainability recession” will double down on responsible business fundamentals. This includes:Investing in new solutionsthat enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and create growth opportunities.Collaborating with partners and industriesto de-risk emerging climate solutions and signal strong demand.Exploring cost-saving measuresthat improve offerings and minimize operational impacts.Adapting to shifting customer preferencesand evolving climate challenges.Diversifying products and servicesto build resilience against market and climate volatility.Fostering a culture of innovationby engaging employees and encouraging bold, sustainability-driven ideas.Making Corporate Climate Innovation ActionableDrawing insights from dozens of corporate innovation experts, Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) recently publishedUnlocking Corporate Climate Innovation, a framework highlighting actionable strategies for driving climate innovation and value creation.The framework examines both in-house and external leverage points available to companies. Internally, this includes integrating sustainability-related, context-based metrics into business structures and incentives, such asMastercard incorporating sustainability progress into bonus calculations. Or creating spaces for staff to channel their sustainability-related ideas and interest into action, likeMicrosoft’s employee sustainability communityof 10,000 staff.Externally, this includes companies collaborating with industries to send collective demand signals to create market readiness for emerging solutions, such as theFirst Movers Coalition’s advance market commitmentsto hard-to-abate sectors like aluminum, concrete, and steel. Or the opportunity to catalyze startups through industry incubators and accelerators targeting value chain challenges, as seen with ABInBev’s100+ Accelerator.ConclusionCorporate sustainability may publicly face a downturn, terms may change, voluntary targets might get modified. None of that will affect the impacts that climate change will have on business.Companies that retreat from climate action now will find themselves scrambling to catch up when they fall behind and those impacts intensify. Conversely, those that recognize the value of climate action and pursue strategic investments during this period of uncertainty will position themselves as industry leaders, ready to navigate a world increasingly shaped by climate impacts.Tags:business value creationcorporate leadershipcorporate sustainabilityinnovationnet zeroRelated ContentQ&A: How Flying Tiger Makes Circularity Key to Value CreationQ&A: How Girteka is Turning Ambition into Action on Net Zero Goals"
Private Equity In Emerging Markets: Opportunities And Challenges For 2025,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesfinancecouncil/2025/03/06/private-equity-in-emerging-markets-opportunities-and-challenges-for-2025/,"MoneyPrivate Equity In Emerging Markets: Opportunities And Challenges For 2025ByJeffrey Bartel, Forbes Councils Member.forForbes Finance CouncilCOUNCIL POSTExpertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author.| Membership (fee-based)Mar 06, 2025, 07:15am ESTSave ArticleJeff Bartelis chairman and managing director of Hamptons Group, a private investment and strategic advisory firm headquartered in Miami.gettyEmerging market private equity investment hasgrown in popularityin recent years, and that trend will likely continue in 2025. Certain areas that are rapidly growing, becoming more urban and adding new industries are ideal for investment.As the areas grow, the need for innovation and investment only compounds and offers more opportunities. As with any investment, there are risks, but when private equity investors carefully assess and prepare for the opportunities, the possibility of financial success only increases.Why Emerging Markets Attract Private Equity InvestorsWhen it comes to private equity investment, locations that are experiencing increased growth in areas such as the economy are the most attractive. These includeLatin America, Southeast Asiaandparts of Africa.Key indicators that areas may have investment potential include faster GDP growth, an increasing middle class and a demographic mix that can support investment. Because these areas are growing, they have infrastructure and urban development needs that offer strong potential for investment growth over time. Also, many governments in these areas will adjust regulations to increase the appeal for foreign investment.Key Sectors For Private Equity Investment In Emerging MarketsInvestment is not equal in all sectors. The areas with the most potential, in my opinion, are healthcare, technology, infrastructure and energy. Digital technology is changing how people operate with the growth of internet access and smartphones around the world. Startups that can quickly meet the needs of local consumers will likely be successful because of the changes to information access. Government incentives also make it easier for investment in financial areas such as fintech and e-commerce. Finally, energy and energy storage investments are often successful, especially in the renewable areas of solar and wind.In emerging markets, Hamptons Group has successfully invested in infrastructure, housing and transportation projects, understanding the important role of these sectors for sustainable economic development. Our firm has selectively invested in transportation and logistics projects that enhance the movement of goods, alleviate congestion and enhance linkages, which are critical for business development and the movement of workers in developing economies.With the growth of urbanization and middle-class development in emerging markets, untapped investment opportunities are now also available in the areas of transportation and housing. Additionally, as populations continue to age, healthcare is a source of constant demand for new and more advanced solutions.Managing Risks In Emerging Markets Private EquityRisk is an ever-present factor in all investments, and although emerging market investments are growing, so is the risk. This is often the result of instability in markets, political changes and government regulation. Because of the international nature of some private equity investments, there is risk of political policy changes or global tensions impacting financial returns. Additionally, since many of these areas are growing quickly, regulations may not always have caught up to the need, and it can be hard to predict the outcome of compliance or performance goals.Investors need to develop risk management strategies, review existing regulations, conduct a market analysis and understand the local political environment. Potential solutions include:• Choosing sectors for investment carefully to lower the impact of local conflicts.• Finding local partners, groups or experts who can offer insights and intelligence from their understanding of regulations and cultural needs.• Developing exit strategies and backup plans to be ready for sudden challenges.The Role Of ESG In Emerging Markets Private EquityMore than ever, environmental, social and governance considerations are a necessary part of investment strategy. Resource availability and climate change are two environmental factors to consider. At the same time, an understanding of cultural and social needs is necessary when it comes to labor considerations and community impact. Finally, successful governance planning is necessary to show transparency and help lower the risk of corruption and improve operations.Our firm incorporates ESG principles into its investment strategy, and we know that responsible and sustainable investments deliver financial returns and long-term societal benefits. One of our key initiatives includes renewable energy infrastructure projects in geographies where access to clean energy is both an economic and environmental necessity. Moreover, our involvement in sustainable agriculture ventures in Africa has shown that ethical labor and resource practices are not only good for the planet, but they result in better productivity and local economic strength. Our firm is dedicated to identifying and scaling ESG-aligned investments that can have measurable impact and increase investor confidence.When businesses understand the benefits of setting up and following an ESG plan, they are generally rewarded with easier access to international funding, have smoother transitions in changing regulations, and build trust. Investors who understand the value that it brings to them will find it easier to locate and manage private equity opportunities. When both companies and investors can leverage social and environmental needs, there will be more successful returns on both the financial return and growth to the local area.Future Trends In Emerging Markets Private EquityAssessing the future is not always easy, but with the advancement in digital technology, private equity has many opportunities. E-commerce, fintech, education and healthcare are all areas where recent technological advancements have made solutions more accessible to emerging markets. ESG investment can provide strong financial returns along with the development of underserved markets. Private equity firms that can locate these emerging markets, follow ESG practices and build local partnerships will have a good chance of success with their investments.The information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

Labour MPs urge investors to support defence firms,"{'id': None, 'name': 'BBC News'}",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clydjk2454qo,"Labour MPs urge investors to support defence firms2 days agoShareSaveShareSaveGetty ImagesMore than 100 Labour MPs and peers have urged banks and investment firms to relax their rules on investing in defence companies.In an open letter, firstreported by the Financial Times, they said ""ill considered"" ethical investment rules had been holding back their access to finance.They wrote that a change in approach would help the UK bolster its defences, and contribute to the government's drive to boost economic growth.It also reflects a trend in recent years to emphasise the national security element of defence investment since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Defence firms 'need reassuring' that big orders will be long-termStarmer cuts aid to fund increase in defence spendingLeading weapons companies have seen sales and their share price surge in recent years, as countries seek to rearm after years of declining defence spending.The UK is among those countries committing to ramp up spending, with Sir Keir Starmer announcing plans last week toincrease defence spendingfrom 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027, funded by cuts to overseas aid.However in their letter, the politicians argued that environmental, social and governance (ESG) rules adopted by some banks and fund managers are continuing to impact the sector's access to finance.They said ESG rules, which can prevent investment in oil, tobacco and other sectors deemed unethical, had generally driven ""positive change"" in the economy.But they added that financial institutions should ""rethink ESG mechanisms that often wrongly exclude all defence investment"".The letter was co-ordinated by the Labour Growth Group, a group of MPs formed last year in part to push the government to deliver major infrastructure projects.'Way of life'Some investment funds have adopted specific rules against investing in weapons manufacturers and others have broader rules obliging them to consider the risk that investment could lead to human rights breaches.But some analysts have pointed out that attitudes on the ethics of investing in the sector appear to have shifted in recent years, with the share of ESG funds holding shares in defence and aerospace firms on the up compared to 2022.The previous Conservative government had also sought to encourage defence investment, with former prime minister Rishi Sunak arguing there is ""nothing more ethical than defending our way of life"".The Investment Association, the trade body for UK investment managers, signed a statement last year stating that investment in ""good, high-quality, well-run defence companies"" was compatible with ESG considerations.Banking rulesIn their letter, the MPs and peers also argued that defence firms faced ""unnecessary barriers to doing business in the UK,"" echoing longstanding complaints from the sector about access to finance.ADS, the industry lobby group, has previously argued that defence firms face higher regulatory barriers when it comes to securing bank accounts and loans.These include rules obliging banks to run enhanced money laundering checks for defence and security companies, and to make sure they are not financing weapons banned under international treaties.The group has also said defence companies can often find it harder to provide relevant documents to banks because of national security considerations.Finance UK, a group representing British banks, acknowledged that compliance rules could prove ""complex"" but said banks provided a ""significant range of support"" to defence companies.David Raw, the group's managing director for commercial finance, added: ""We are continuing to engage with government and the defence sector to tackle any barriers that do arise.""We do not see a tension between supporting ESG goals and supporting the defence sector.""The UK-based Campaign Against the Arms Trade said it opposed any change to ESG rules on defence firms, adding it would benefit firms that ""make vast profits from death and destruction across the world"".UK defence spendingLabour Party"
Are You Hindering Your Retirement By Not Investing In Gender Equality?,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jbrewer/2025/03/06/are-you-hindering-your-retirement-by-not-investing-in-gender-equality/,"MoneyPersonal FinanceAre You Hindering Your Retirement By Not Investing In Gender Equality?ByJames Brewer, Contributor.Empowering smarter money moves.Follow AuthorMar 06, 2025, 11:40am ESTSave ArticleCommentDiscussing investing in gender equality as part of gender diversitygettyWhile there has been much conversation on not buying from companies with poor diversity, little has been said about investing in gender equality. Specifically companies that have strong gender equality policies. As we celebrate Women’s History Month in 2025, it's essential to address the unique challenges women face in preparing for retirement. Despite significant strides in gender equality, women often encounter financial hurdles that can impact their retirement savings. This article offers practical strategies to help women, especially those mindful of social values and sustainability, secure a comfortable and values-aligned retirement.Why Investing In Gender Equality Could Mean Higher ReturnsNumerous studies have shown that companies with higher gender diversity in leadership generate better financial results. According toMcKinsey & Company, companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 25% more likely to outperform financially similar companies in the same market.Additionally, McKinsey's 2015 report highlighted that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity were 15% more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians.Why? More diverse leadership teams lead to better decision-making, higher innovation, and stronger risk management.The YourStake data confirms this trend, as the optimized portfolio had higher returns and lower volatility.Incorporating Investing In Gender Equality Into Your PortfolioAligning investments with personal values is increasingly important. Gender-lens investing focuses on companies that promote gender equality and women’s advancement. Tools like As You Sow’sGender Equality Fundstool allow investors to compare mutual funds based on gender-lens scores and financial performance, helping to identify sustainable investment options that align with personal values.How Does Investing In Gender Equality Perform?In the world of investing, aligning financial goals with personal values is becoming a core strategy for investors who care about social impact. Using YourStake, a values-driven research group, I created a detailed analysis of three distinct investment options:MORE FOR YOUNetflix’s Best New Show Nabs A Perfect 100% Critic Score, 94% AudienceElon Musk Is Officially $121 Billion Poorer Than His Peak—As Tesla Stock Erases Most All Of Its Election RallyToday’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Thursday, March 6thiShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETFThis exchange traded fund replicates The MSCI KLD 400 Social Index, a capitalization weighted index of 400 US securities that provides exposure to companies with outstanding Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings and excludes companies whose products have negative social or environmental impacts.

TIAA has a fiduciary responsibility to manage those investments to generate the highest income for its participants. So, let’s say TIAA decides to rid itself of its fossil fuel holdings. The risk is that if the new investments produce lower earnings than its current fossil fuel holdings, its participants will be unhappy, and may even sue.But what if fossil fuel investments, which have beendragging for a decade, are headed toward disaster? Retirement funds are responsible for both the short- and the long-term. I am a near-retirement TIAA participant. I have a particular interest in my retirement funds not crashing over the next 20 years to the point where I am not able to recover their value during my lifetime. Young investors are concerned about the profitability of their investments over the next 50 or more years. Can we count on fossil fuel investments being profitable over the near-term, let alone 50 years?DENVER, CO - JUNE 13, 2015: The TIAA-CREF (Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association - College... [+]Retirement Equities Fund) building in downtown Denver, Colorado. (Photo by Robert Alexander/Getty Images)Getty ImagesWith the global average temperature having crossed the 1.5°C threshold, extreme floods and fires are razing homes and businesses, leading insurance companies to withdraw from risky markets. And yet, fund managers continue to invest in the very products that are driving these catastrophes. Why? University College Londoneconomist Steve Keenpoints out that economists lack knowledge of the science of global warming. For example, in refereed articles, economists have claimed that if the planet warms to 6°C above pre-industrial temperatures, the global GDP will shrink by less than 10%, and investment consultants have advised pension funds that global warming of 2-4.3°C will have only a minimal impact on their portfolios. In contrast, scientists predict that even 1°C of warming—which we have already passed—could trigger dangerous climate tipping points and any rise over 5°C will result in damages “beyond catastrophic, including existential threats”–that is, the end of humanity as we know it.Before retirement portfolio managers canprudentlyfulfill their fiduciary duties, they need accurate information about the prevailing risks posed by a climate change future. Yet, no one with climate science expertise sits on TIAA's Board of Directors.What are the climate risks confronting prudent fiduciaries?The risks that climate change poses to retirement incomes are not distant and small, but immediate and potentially wealth-destroying. According to theCenter for International Environmental Law, those risks encompass:Physical impactSea level rise, unprecedented floods, and raging fires are some of the physical effects of climate change. In the U.S., fossil fuel refining and export infrastructure is concentrated along the hurricane ravaged Gulf Coast, creating significant risk of disruptions to oil and gas markets. In 2020, Hurricane Laura shuttered Cameron LNG in Louisiana for over a month. And after Hurricane Harvey hit Houston and Port Arthur in 2017, US retail gasoline prices rose by 13% in a matter of weeks.BLACK HAWK, LA - MAY 18:  Flooded oil derricks are seen on May 18, 2011 in Black Hawk, Louisiana....

Heavy rains have left the ground saturated, rivers swollen, and have caused widespread flooding in Louisiana. Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Arkansas.  (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Getty ImagesStranded assetsAs societies confront the real costs of climate change, they are moving away from fossil fuels, resulting in billions of dollars in stranded assets. For example, TIAA is the world’s 4th largest holder of coal bonds, even as the three coal plants it owns are shuttered. TheWorld Economic Forumestimates that the world would realize a net gain of $85 trillion from phasing out coal power, or 1.3% of current world GDP per annum leading to 2100.HOMER CITY, UNITED STATES - JUNE 12:  With the shuttered Homer City Power Plant in the background,...

The soil, contaminated by coal refuse, is cleaned and returned to the land where it is encased and covered with top soil and planted as a meadow. Ever since the Homer City power plant closed in June 2023, the town has been looking into an uncertain future with the loss of jobs and the largest contribution to their tax base. (Photo by Scott Lewis for The Washington Post via Getty Images)The Washington Post via Getty ImagesEnergy transitionThe transition to a low-carbon, renewable energy economy is here--and it’s happening a lot faster than forecast. TheInternational Energy Agencypredicts that renewables will overtake coal as the leading source of electricity this year, and that fossil fuel demand will peak by 2030. Further, solar investment in India and the U.S. is expected to reach nearly $25 billion over 2022-2027, a sevenfold increase over the previous five years. The 85% acceleration in expansion of renewables from 2022-27 is nearly 30% higher than forecast.LitigationAccording to theCenter for Biological Diversity, by December 2024, eleven attorneys general and dozens of municipal and Tribal governments had filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies for deceiving the public about fossil fuel’s role in climate change. In responding to litigation brought by the city of Honolulu, the U.S.Supreme Courtdenied an appeal from fossil fuel companies to block lawsuits holding them responsible for billions of dollars of damages due to climate change. The Town of Carrboro NC has alleged that Duke Energy deceived the public about the transition away from fossil fuels and should be held responsible for the costs to rebuild after Hurricane Helene. And Oregon’s Multnomah County sued fossil fuel corporations for their role in the area’s fatal 2021 heat dome.The Center for International Environmental Law summarizes the physical, asset stranding, energy transition, and litigation risks for the oil and gas industry:Fossil fuel companies that have rigs and rely on extensive infrastructure face physical impact risks; the effort to reduce carbon emissions may strand significant fossil fuel assets;changing demand for carbon-intensive fuels, the emergence of new technologies, and evolving regulations will subject fossil fuel companies to transition risk; and the impacts of climate change on property and human populations may present significant litigation risk.Port Arthur,TX, September 17,2008 — Debris lines the side of a road near an oil refinery in Port... [+]Arthur,TX left in the wake of Hurricane IKE.Photo by Patsy Lynch/FEMAWhat fiduciary duties are triggered by climate risk?Given known climate risks,prudentfiduciaries have duties to evaluate investment risks, monitor portfolios on a continuing basis, and act in accordance with updated plans. They must act solely in the interests of fund beneficiaries, including protecting them from misleading information, diversifying holdings to minimize risk, and acting impartially so as to not jeopardize long-term viability of investments to maximize short-term gains. According to theCenter for International Environmental Law,All of these duties are triggered by the reality of climate change and how it will impact our financial markets, our society, and our global economy. Actively engaging with these financial challenges and opportunities can shield a fund from unnecessary risk and loss while allowing it to achieve prudent, safe growth. A failure to acknowledge and act to address these risks may lead to financial loss, litigation, and liability.To understand how fiduciaries balance their duties in light of climate risk, I reached out toGreg King, Chair of the Denver Deferred Compensation Retirement Board (who is also my son-in-law). He explained:Because climate has become a culture war issue, fiduciaries are backed into a corner. If they divest from fossil fuels, they could be sued by participants who think that their investments have underperformed, and if they don’t divest, they could be sued by participants who see fossil fuels as posing an existential threat to humanity.Mr. King feels that a lot of the responsibility for addressing the climate crisis rests with the organizations hiring TIAA or another firm to manage their funds. For example, the City of Denver established a Retirement Board, which holds meetings six times per year, where participants are able to speak about emerging trends such as the climate emergency. Similar opportunities for input are not available to TIAA’s university participants. Further, whereas universities allow TIAA to market its own funds, Denver’s retirement fund provider is not allowed to offer its branded funds to participants. This opens up their offerings to a large and diverse group of funds, including ESG and fossil fuel-free options. Mr. King envisions that in the future, universities might pressure retirement fund companies to be more transparent in their reporting, and even lobby the federal government to standardize ESG criteria so all funds follow the same rules.DENVER - NOVEMBER 15:  Downtown Denver skyline, photographed from the Jacquard Hotel rooftop in... [+]Denver, Colorado on November 15, 2018.  (Photo By Raymond Boyd/Getty Images)Getty ImagesTIAA is addressing climate risks, but TIAA-Divest says progress is shamefully slowTIAA-Divest has made ten demands of TIAA and its subsidiary Nuveen. One demand is that the retirement company divest from all direct fossil fuel investments immediately and lay out a clear, rapid path to moving its funds away from all coal, oil, and gas. Another demand is transparency. Although TIAA says that it aligns its portfolio with a 1.5oC pathway, it does not disclose its portfolio-wide emissions. The complainants argue that TIAA actively misleads its participants by offering so-called ESG and “social responsibility” funds that are “awash in fossil fuels.” In a meeting with TIAA ESG and engagement leaders, TIAA-Divest complainants felt stymied in their attempts to learn more about the company’s ESG commitments.I experienced this lack of transparency when I reached out to TIAA head of Responsible Investing, Amy O’Brien, with a list of questions to help clarify their response to the claims brought by TIAA-Divest. Rather than responding to the charges, a “TIAA spokesperson” asked me to state the following in my article:Our purpose is investing for future generations to thrive. Rather than divest from major sectors of the economy, we seek to manage climate risk across a diversified portfolio. We believe this makes us better investors and stewards on behalf of our clients.We are fully committed to ensuring our clients have clear publicly available information on how we manage climate risks and opportunities for their investments. We continue to enhance transparency on this topic to align with the evolving needs of our participants and the world around us.We consider a wide range of stakeholder perspectives as we constantly evaluate how we can better serve our clients’ long-term financial interests in a responsible way.Frustrated by the vague language in the TIAA response, I reached out to TIAA investment management arm Nuveen, but received no response.TIAA did share its2024 climate reportwith the unfortunate title of “Staying the Course.” According to the report, TIAA “asked 100 portfolio companies that comprise most of our public markets financed emissions to disclose material climate-related information and to establish industry-leading strategies to manage climate risks. As the energy transition matures, so will our assessment of company progress—shifting from standard disclosure to robust planning to implementation.” An example of company engagement comes from Chevron, where TIAA advocated for the fossil fuel giant to participate in the “United Nation’s (sic) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 … and continuously engaged Chevron on its methane abatement strategies…”. (YetChevroncontinues to bet on a fossil fueled future.) TIAA plans to transition from asking its companies for transparency to accountability to impact over the next 25 years, reaching net zero emissions in its General Accounts by 2050. For TIAA-Divest and the planet, this is too little too late.MANHATTAN, NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - 2024/09/24: Participant seen holding a sign at the protest. As...

(Photo by Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images)LightRocket via Getty ImagesTo date, eleven universities have passed resolutions asking TIAA to divest from fossil fuels, and in 2024, theAmerican Association of University Professorsadopted a resolution urging universities and retirement funds, including TIAA, to divest from fossil fuels.This spring, TIAA-Divest is implementing its “seven university strategy,” using TIAA’s biggest university clients’ combined leverage of $20 billion in TIAA investments to pressure the retirement company to take faster and more comprehensive action, appropriate to their fiducial duties and the risks posed by climate change.According to Caroline Levine, a national TIAA-Divest leader and professor of English at Cornell University (my employer), she and her colleagues realize that TIAA may not meet all their demands. They would be thrilled to see a climate scientist on the TIAA Board of Directors, and they expect TIAA to offer participants more choices in investing in fossil-free funds. (I tried to change my investments to fossil-free funds last year, and the TIAA advisor could only show me two such funds among hundreds to choose from.) TIAA-Divest would also like to see TIAA hold open meetings where participants can listen in and comment, as is common in other retirement funds.Professor Levine remains puzzled by lack of TIAA action. The urgency of fossil fuel divestment seems obvious as students increasingly share with professors their experiences of destructive floods, heat domes, and fires threatening their homes. Expressing her frustration, Levine shared“As university teachers and researchers, we spend our lives committing to the wellbeing of students whose future is in our hands. At the same time, we are destroying these students’ futures with our investments.”1The $78 billion figure is from a 2022 report from theInstitute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. In its2024 climate report, TIAA reported that they hold $38.4 billion in fossil fuels—still a sizable number.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"
US Anger Grows Over Global Reach of EU’s ‘Hostile’ ESG Rules,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Insurance Journal'}",https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2025/03/06/814486.htm,"US Anger Grows Over Global Reach of EU’s ‘Hostile’ ESG RulesByFrances Schwartzkopff|March 6, 2025Email ThisSubscribe to NewsletterArticle2 CommentsAs trans-Atlantic relations grow increasingly fraught, Europe’s ESG regulations are becoming yet another flashpoint that threatens to sour ties.The American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union (AmCham EU) says proposed revisions to the bloc’s environmental, social and governance rules don’t adequately protect US interests. The complaint is part of a growing US response to Europe’s ESG framework. Republican lawmakers call the rules “hostile” and warn that America’s jurisdictional sovereignty is at stake, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said he’s willing to consider “trade tools” to retaliate.The European Commission proposed changes last week that would rein in the scope of two major ESG laws: the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. However, big international companies with business in the EU would still have to comply.The upshot is that non-EU companies risk being ensnared by the bloc’s ESG rules, even for products that aren’t sold in the EU, saidKim Watts, senior policy manager for AmCham EU, whose members include Ford Motor Co., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.AmCham is worried that the EU “is going too far on extraterritoriality,” she said in an interview.It’s a complaint that’s being backed up in even stronger terms by GOP members of Congress. In alettersent shortly after the European Commission published its proposed revisions to the bloc’s ESG rules, the US lawmakers wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, warning of the “profound” implications of Europe’s due diligence directive for US businesses.“CSDDD represents a serious and unwarranted regulatory overreach, imposing significant economic and legal burdens on US companies,” lawmakers, including Representatives James French Hill of Arkansas, Ann Wagner of Missouri and Andy Barr of Kentucky, wrote in the letter. “We strongly urge immediate diplomatic engagement to challenge and halt its implementation.” The group also called for clarification to ensure US companies won’t have to develop climate transition plans.AmCham EU said its concerns apply to both CSRD, which is a reporting requirement, and CSDDD, which is designed to include value chains in ESG risk assessments.A spokesperson for the commission said the views of all stakeholders were considered before its latest proposal was put forward.CSDDD was originally designed so that companies in breach of the directive would face fines of as much as 5% of their global revenue. Work on the directive was propelled in part by the 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh, which killed more than 1,100 people who had been working on clothes intended for western markets.The shock of that event led to a new sensitivity around supply-chain risks, which EU authorities were determined to act on. CSDDD also reflects the goals of the 2015 Paris climate accord, such that companies are expected to have plausible net zero plans.But the far-reaching ramifications of CSDDD led to widespread pushback, both from within and outside the EU. The commission responded to that pressure last week by dropping an EU-wide civil liability provision and limiting the length of the value chain in the directive.Those changes still leave US companies in the directive’s scope, something the US Chamber of Commerce says creates “conflicts with American law.”“The extraterritoriality, it’s not unsolvable, but there needs to be more dialog and attention on this to understand the scale and the scope of the issue here,” Watts said. “We need more understanding from the commission on the challenges that businesses face with trying to comply with extremely, rather vague and complex legislation.”Ideally, CSDDD should “refer to an EU-nexus chain of activity,” she said. That would mean the EU should “focus the due diligence on the chain of activities that have an end result in the European market rather than focus very broadly on elements that might not be linked to the single market at all.”Watts said CSRD reporting requirements exceed in some cases those in the US, which leaves companies “open to scrutiny by US investors who are looking for statements that could be the basis of securities litigation.”AmCham EU members remain committed to their sustainability goals and would like to avoid a trade battle over ESG, Watts said. Tariffs are “a very bad idea” and “not constructive,” she said.The commission’s proposal still needs to be voted on by lawmakers and member states. And there’s likely to be much more “political wrangling ahead,” particularly as the EU Parliament is “currently very divided,” said Sophie Tuson, head of the environmental unit at the London law firm RPC.Lara Wolters, the member of parliament who shepherded CSDDD through to adoption last year, has labeled the commission’s proposal “reckless.” She’s now calling on the European Parliament to “succeed where the commission has failed,” which she says entails “finding a compromise for common-sense simplification, without lowering standards.”At AmCham EU, the goal is to impress upon the EU that adjustments are still needed to its ESG regulations to ensure the framework is “workable for all non EU-headquartered businesses and also European businesses with a global presence,” Watts said.Photo:Photographer: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/BloombergCopyright 2025 Bloomberg.TopicsUSAEuropeWas this article valuable?YesNoThank you!

5 Best Practices That Prevent Data Bottlenecks In The Customer Onboarding Experience,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/03/06/5-best-practices-that-prevent-data-bottlenecks-in-the-customer-onboarding-experience/,"Innovation5 Best Practices That Prevent Data Bottlenecks In The Customer Onboarding ExperienceByAlex Ford, Forbes Councils Member.forForbes Technology CouncilCOUNCIL POSTExpertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author.| Membership (fee-based)Mar 06, 2025, 08:30am ESTSave ArticleAlex Ford is president ofEncompass, North America.gettyDigital identity has transformed retail banking. With a driver’s license and few supporting documents, individuals can typically open an account in minutes. But with corporate clients, the onboarding and verification process is significantly more complex. A2024 studyconducted by Encompass in partnership with Chartis found that the average time to onboard a corporate banking client is 90 to 120 days. Leagues of documents necessary to meet Know Your Customer/Know Your Business regulations leave banks with a bottleneck of data that complicates and slows the onboarding process, frustrating customers and soaking up time and resources within the organization.Common Challenges With Customer DataMost banks understand that they are behind when it comes to modernizing their practices, so many are undergoing digital transformations in hopes of growing their businesses responsibly while providing better service to customers. Unfortunately, clunky processes like exchanging paper documents and searching through informational websites with poor UX are still causing bottlenecks, even in digital-forward banks.Good customer journeys and KYC compliance depend on healthy data, but banks often struggle with:• Conflicting data from hundreds of disparate sources, which makes choosing “which one to believe” difficult and time consuming and may also lead to inaccuracies. Corporate and institutional divisions of banks often draw from as many as 200 sources to find the KYC data necessary.• Unverifiable data that lacks a traceable source.• Low-quality data that is out of date, duplicated or flawed, which can trigger alarms to regulators and lengthen the compliance process.• Data is frequently out of date, which can complicate the compliance process.• No standard of what data is needed to reach compliance, forcing analysts to constantly reinvent the wheel.Five Ways To Unlock The Data BottleneckA digital transformation isn’t complete until the data bottleneck is cleared. These five best practices can help any organization uncork its bottleneck with better data practices.1. Standardize required data.Knowing which data is necessary to create a complete profile for regulatory purposes improves the speed of data collection and approval while protecting against redundancies. A standardized approach can also help to mitigate risk as well as provide a single, replicable data portrait for each customer that’s easy to use and share.2. Automate data workflows.Automating parts of the data collection, verification and filing processes can reduce human error and increase speed. This not only streamlines the onboarding process, but it also increases operational efficiency and allows resources to be redirected to activities that require more human interaction.3. Rank sources by trustworthiness.When presented with conflicting data from disparate sources, banks can save time by comparing the sources via pre-determined trustworthiness hierarchy. Using data from only the most trusted sources can lead to greater accuracy and better risk-related decision-making.4. Share customer profiles throughout your organization.Too often, customers are asked to provide the same information repeatedly by different departments in an organization. This frustrates customers, as it wastes their time and makes the organization look disorganized. Instead, digitize the attributes and documents needed to create customer profiles so they can be leveraged throughout the organization. Once client information has been digitized, there are so many ways to use it across the bank, such as reporting on capital adequacy ratios, tax compliance use cases, ESG and credit underwriting. This can increase the organization's efficiency and therefore ROI on technology and transformation initiatives.5. Be proactive with updates.Data changes such as ownership transfers can happen at any time, potentially changing risk positions and compromising compliance. Organizations can now automatically and proactively check for data updates on their clients at scale and at a frequency commensurate with the client type and risk profile. Almost as importantly, banks can now quickly verify when there has been “no change” and apply resources accordingly. This protects the organization from risks and supports ongoing compliance. Updates to customer profiles can be done with automation to reduce time and resource investment while still keeping KYC information up to date.Compliance And Convenience Can CoexistTransitioning from manual data collection and verification to a total digital transformation is a tremendous step in the right direction for banks and organizations that want to streamline and simplify their KYC compliance process, but simply digitizing information is not enough. To eliminate data bottlenecks, automation, standardization and proactivity are the core virtues to build processes upon. These five data best practices can help any organization reduce redundancies, human error and friction while providing a better customer experience.Forbes Technology Councilis an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.Do I qualify?Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"

The Combined Cipher Machine 1940's-1950's,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Blogspot.com'}",http://chris-intel-corner.blogspot.com/2025/03/the-combined-cipher-machine-1942-1962.html,"Christos military and intelligence cornerMilitary and intelligence history mostly dealing with World War II.Wednesday, March 5, 2025The Combined Cipher machine - 1942-1962Cipher
machines were extensively used by both the Axis and the Allies during WWII.The Germans
had theEnigma, theLorenz SZ 40/42and theSiemens T-52.The Japanese
had theType B Cipher Machine (Angooki Taipu
B).The
Americans had theConverter M-134-C (SIGABA)and theHagelin M-209.The British
had theTypex.Another
machine that became increasingly important for the Allies, in the period
1943-45, was the Combined Cipher Machine - CCM. Unfortunately, this machine has
not received a lot of attention from historians because there is limited
information available on its internal operation and use in the field.Here I have
attempted to present information on the CCM from various sources that are not
easy to find (the timelines section has detailed sources):Historical
overviewThe need for
a combined US-UK cipher system was apparent by 1941 so the British gave the
Americans their Naval Cypher No 3 (a codebook enciphered with additive tables)
for use in the N. Atlantic convoy operations.The
Americans wanted to use theM-138-A strip cipherand the M-209 cipher machine for
intercommunication but both were rejected by the British. On the other hand,
the Typex cipher machine which was considered secure could not be manufactured
in large numbers. The British wanted the SIGABA but the Americans were not
willing to share their high-level cipher machine or divulge its operating
principle to their Allies.Instead, a
compromise solution was reached. A cipher attachment was developed by the US
Navy (by Lt. Commander Donald W. Seiler USNR) that could be installed in the
SIGABA and the Typex and it turned them into the Combined Cipher Machine – CCM.
The CCM cipher attachment was a 5-rotor non reciprocal system issued with 10
reversible rotors.Three
versions were produced:1). The CSP
1600 (CCM Mk I), which was a modification of an existing SIGABA with the CCM
attachment installed.2). The CSP
1700 (CCM Mk II), which was a SIGABA with a fixed CCM attachment.3). The CSP
1800 (CCM Mk III), which was an adapter for the British Typex cipher machine
(Typex Mk 23).Production
started in December 1942 and by November 1943 enough machines had been
distributed to naval units to introduce the system in the North Atlantic. In
April ’44 the CCM became operational with all five British and American armed
services. By May ’45 the CCM was used extensively by the British Army, RAF and
Navy.Total
production was at least 8.631 adapters and self-contained machines.Operation
and crypto security of the CCM (standard version)(a):5 rotors –
Positions 12345Rotors have
fixed cam contours (notches).Rotor No3
steps with every key depression, it moves rotors No2 and No4, rotor No2 moves
rotor No1 and rotor No4 moves rotor No5.Non
reciprocal encipherment (cipher-decipher function)10
reversible rotors issued - 967.680 possible wheel ordersCertain
rotor combinations can cause a machine period of only 338.Message
length limited to 200 groups in a messageMessage procedure (1944):Two 5-letter
indicators placed at the start and the end of the message. First indicator is
the crypto net indicator, the second is the enciphered message wheel order.The wheel
order used to encipher the message (chosen at random) is enciphered on the key
list’s initial code wheel alignment (contained in the keylist) before being
sent as the second message indicator.US
procedure: Different initial code wheel alignment for SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL and
RESTRICTED messages.US-UK
combined cipher procedure:Two different
initial code wheel alignments titled (A) and (B). The key list in use will
define the classifications of messages for which (A) and (B) are to be used.Cryptosecurity
problems:As early as
1943 it was discovered that under certain conditions the device had a
dangerously low cipher period of 338.A detailed
study of the CCM’s period was not begun by OP-20-GM until 16 January 1944, six
months after the short cycle defect was first discovered. The OP-20-GM
investigation showed that, on one CCM circuit alone, seven daily keys between
12 February and 20 April 1944 produced the short 338 period. Once the problem
of the short period had been fully identified, it could be avoided by taking
various precautions, including the banning of certain rotor combinations and
drastically restricting the length of messages. However, problems with
lobstering rotors and the resulting short cycles were still being detected as
late as March 1945.A security
evaluation in July ’44 came to the conclusion that despite these problems the
CCM was a well-designed cipher machine since it had close to a million possible
wheel orders, was non reciprocal so cribs could not be placed with certainty
and the irregular stepping of the end rotors countered the cyclometric stepping
of the fast-moving rotor No3.Postwar
developments:In 1946 the
CCM was acquired by the State Department and given the designation MCB. The modified
version used by the State Department was the CSP 2200, with some rotors moving
backwards. It continued to be used till July 1959. It was replaced by a cipher
machine developed by the State Department called MEC.In US and UK
service the standard CCM was given the codename AJAX and in the early 1950’s
the rotor stepping system was modified in order to increase crypto security.
This version was called HERMES. It was replaced in the mid 1950’s by theKL-7 ADONIS. Another CCM version was codenamed LUCIFER but there is no
information available on whether its stepping system had been modified.NATO
selected the CCM in 1951 to serve as the cipher system for second level
communications (Naval, Army and Air Force Commands, down to Divisional H.Q.
plus NATO war vessels). It was modified into the HERMES standard in 1952 and
replaced by theKL-7 ADONISin 1956. A number of CCM machines
continued to be used for meteorological traffic and as a reserve till 1962.The CCM
HERMES modification (1952)(b)In the early
1950’s the standard CCM was modified:The stepping
of the rotors was changed so that ‘The purpose of this modification is to
change the rotor stepping pattern so that the No. 1 rotor stepping contact
(operated by rotor No. 2) will control the stepping of rotor No. 5, and the No.
4 rotor stepping contact (operated by rotor No. 4) will control the stepping of
rotor No. 1’.Thus, it
seems that in the HERMES version rotor No3 steps with every key depression, it
moves rotors No2 and No4, rotor No2 moves rotor No5 and rotor No4 moves rotor
No1.Non
reciprocal encipherment (cipher-decipher function)20
reversible rotors were issued per machine (instead of the original 10) so that
the possible wheel orders were increased to 59.535.360.The wheels
were equipped with rotatable cam contours (notches).Use of
message bisection, padding and variable spacing in order to counter cribbing.Message
length was 300 groups.Simplex message
procedure - HERMES (1952):Two
indicators placed at the start and the end of the message. First indicator is
the crypto net indicator, the second is the message wheel order. The second
indicator is phoneticized and transmitted in clear as the second to sixth
groups of the message.a). For
messages classified Restricted, Confidential and Secret:Single
encipherment.A 5-letter
indicator is selected at random and sent with the message as the second to
sixth 5-letter group (phoneticized). The machine is set up according to the
daily key, the rotors are aligned to the letters of the message indicator, then
the 10-letter Random Group No1 (contained in the keylist, different for each
day) is enciphered and the resultant 10 letters are known as the intermediate
sequence. The intermediate sequence is formed into five digraphs by pairing the
1st letter with the 6th, the 2nd with the 7th, the 3rd with the 8th, the 4th
with the 9th and the 5th with the 10th. The digraphs are then used on the
rotor-setting Table No. 1 (contained in the keylist) in order to identify the 5
rotors to be used for the message and their initial position. If a rotor number
found in a cell is one that has been found in a cell that has already been
recorded, the next cell to the right, which contains an available rotor number,
is used. If the end of the row is reached, the first cell in the same row is
resorted to. The rotors are rearranged and aligned according to the arrangement
and alignment thus recorded from Table No 1. This is the message rotor
arrangement and message rotor alignment on which the message is then
enciphered.b). For
messages classified Top Secret:Double
encipherment.A 5-letter
indicator is selected at random and sent with the message as the second to
sixth 5-letter group (phoneticized). The machine is set up according to the
daily key, the rotors are aligned to the letters of the message indicator and
the 10-letter Random Group No1 and 10-letter Random Group No2 (contained in the
keylist) are enciphered. The resultant 20 letters are the intermediate
sequence. The first ten letters of the intermediate sequence are formed into
five digraphs and used with the rotor-setting Table No. 1 to identify the 5
rotors to be used for the message and their initial position (as above). The
rotors are rearranged and aligned according to the arrangement and alignment
thus recorded from Table No 1 and the message is enciphered. The result is
known as the intermediate cipher text.The message
is enciphered a second time using the following procedure: The second ten
letters of the intermediate sequence are formed into five digraphs by matching the
11th with the 16th, the 12thwiththe 17th, the 13th with the
18th, the 14thwith the 19thand the 15th with the 20th. The
digraphs are then used on the TableNo. 2 (containing letters) and the
letters found in the cells are recorded, regardless of repeats. The rotors are
realigned to the letters thus recorded but they are not rearranged. The
intermediate cipher text is enciphered preceded by the 11th to the 15th letters
of the intermediate sequence and followed by the 16th to the 20th. These groups
are enciphered in these positions to provide a check to the deciphering operator
who, on recognizing them as part of the intermediate sequence, is assured that
the first phase of decipherment has been accomplished correctly.Cryptosecurity
problems:Despite the
modifications to the rotor stepping system, the rotatable cam contours and the
issuing of more rotors the CCM was only expected to remain secure for a few
years and its security depended mainly on the laborious cipher procedures (key
lists, simplex indicators, message bisection, padding, variable spacing) not on
the underlying cryptosecurity of the device.Compromise
of the CCM by foreign powersThe CCM
entered service with the Allied armies in 1943-44 and by that time the German
codebreakers had neither the resources nor the time needed to mount a
determined effort to analyze and solve this cipher machine. Instead, they
focused their limited resources on the Allied systems that they could reliably
exploit.According to
the available information the German Navy’s codebreaking department B-Dienst
investigated the CCM in 1944. Traffic was first recognized in April ’44. During
the summer a study of indicators was carried out. In October ’44 seven messages
with identical first and second indicators were discovered. The system was
thought to use non reciprocal substitution alphabets on plain text. Research
ended in January ’45. No information is available on whether the other German
codebreaking agencies (Inspectorate 7/VI, Luftwaffe Chi Stelle, OKW/Chi)
evaluated the CCM traffic.The use of
the CCM in the postwar period meant that it became a target for the
codebreakers of the Soviet Union. There is information pointing to the
exploitation of the State Department’s MCB and of the Army’s CSP-1700/SIGROD (used
by military attachés) in the 1950’s.The CCM must
have been used by US and British forces during theKorean War of 1950-53. At this time there is no information on its use and
possible compromise in Korea.Timelines:1940- US Navy Department and British
Admiralty agree to use Naval Cypher No3 as the British-American Naval Cypher (1),
US ciphers not authorized to be shared with other countries (2)1941- Naval Cypher No3 distributed to
ships in early 1941 and made effective on 16 June 1941. (3)1942– Talks between US and British
officials regarding a combined cipher system, British book ciphers rejected by
US, US side proposed M-138-A and M-209 and these were rejected by British.
Typex production too low to satisfy need for a combined machine. SIGABA not
released to the British by the US authorities for reasons of national security.
(4)CCM
attachments for SIGABA and Typex were developed mainly by the US Navy by Lt.
Commander Donald W. Seiler USNR (5). By October ’42 a prototype adapter was
demonstrated to the British (6) and the CCM was officially approved by the
Anglo-American Combined Communications Board in October 1942 (7). Production
started in December 1942. (8).Three
versions of the CCM were produced (9):1). The CSP
1600, which was a modification of an existing SIGABA with the CCM attachment
installed. The machine could be converted back into the standard SIGABA.2). The CSP
1700, which was a SIGABA with a fixed CCM attachment. Thus, it could not be
modified back into the standard SIGABA.3). The CSP
1800, which was an adapter for the British Typex cipher machine. The version
with the CCM attachment was called Typex Mk 23.Production(10):ECM adapter

rushed into service with first deliveries in May ’43, Typex Mk 23 adapters
first delivered in July ’43. (11)By 1stNovember 1943 enough machines had been distributed to Atlantic naval units to
introduce the system in the North Atlantic (about 250 British and Canadian
ships equipped with the cipher machine).(12)By 31
December ’43 the system was made effective for Limited Combined Naval Use for
areas outside the North Atlantic.(13)By the end
of 1943, 2,200 Typex adaptors and about 114,000 CCM rotors had been delivered
to Britain and 1,525 ECM adaptors distributed to the US Navy in the Atlantic,
while distribution in the Pacific was about to begin. In addition, about 500
CCM Mk II/CSP 1700 had been supplied to the British and the Canadians, and
about 100 to the US Navy. (14).Tests
carried out during the spring of 1943 at the US Naval Computing Machine
Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio revealed that, when using some rotors, its period
was only 338.(15).1944– In April ’44 the CCM became
operational with all five British and American armed services.(16)By 31
December ’44 1.220 naval Typex machines had been modified into CCM versions.(17)A detailed
study of the CCM’s period was not begun by OP-20-GM until 16 January 1944, six
months after the short cycle defect was first discovered. The OP-20-GM
investigation showed that, on one CCM circuit alone, seven daily keys between
12 February and 20 April 1944 produced the short 338 period. Once the problem

CCM was a well-designed cipher machine since it had close to a million possible
wheel orders, was non reciprocal so cribs could not be placed with certainty
and the irregular stepping of the end rotors countered the cyclometric stepping
of the fast-moving rotor No3. (19)New key
lists and cipher wheel were issued in the period 1944-45.(20)The German
Navy’s codebreaking department B-Dienst investigated the CCM in 1944. Traffic
first recognized in April ’44. During the summer a study of indicators was
carried out. In October ’44 seven messages with identical first and second
indicators were discovered. The system was thought to use non reciprocal

information is available on whether the other German codebreaking agencies
(Inspectorate 7/VI, Luftwaffe Chi Stelle, OKW/Chi) worked on the CCM.1945– From the middle of ’44 up to
February ’45 the CCM was distributed to the British Pacific Fleet and equipped
all major war vessels. (22)By May ’45
the CCM was used extensively by the British Army, RAF and Navy. (23)On 1 January
1945 a new indicator system was introduced. (24)In February
’45 the CCM rotor basket (CSP 1600 – SIGAMUG) and basic rotors (CCBP 0111) are
considered compromised (Colmar incident). The CCM material is lost when a truck
containing the28thInfantry Division’sSIGABA cipher machine was stolen
from Colmar, France. Traffic in the compromised systems was initially suspended.
Eventually, this basic rotor set continued to be used by the fighting forces
because there was no other alternative. The compromise of the CCM rotors
revealed a serious deficiency in the emergency plan for the CCM since no
provision had been made for the production and storing of reserve rotors. (25)In March ’45
the crypto material lost in Colmar was discovered submerged in the Greesen
River. (25)From
February to August ’45 17.840 new rotors were wired to replace the compromised
set CCBP 0111. (25)CCM

(AJAX, SIGROD, HERMES, LUCIFER, MCB):The standard
CCM system in US service is codenamed AJAX. The Army’s CSP 1700 is designated
SIGROD. The SIGROD is distributed to military attachés. The HERMES modification
is introduced in 1952. A CCM LUCIFER is mentioned in 1953. (26)State
Department1946-1950’s- In early ’46 the
State Department retired theM-325 SIGFOYcipher machine and replaced it with the CCM. The version
used by the State Department was the CSP 2200 (HCM Mark 4/SCM Mark 2) (27). In
State Department use the CCM was designated MCB (28). The MCB continued to be used
till July 1959 (29).US, UK,
NATO1946-1950’s– Discussions are held between US
and British crypto experts on the need to modify the CCM in order to increase
its security or design a new cipher machine to replace it. Concern over CCM
security problems. Some interesting statements are made in these reports:1947– ‘In the opinion of the British,
the present Combined Cipher Machine (CCM) is not sufficiently secure to resist
increasingly effective cryptanalytic techniques. In addition, the British are
anxious to develop a replacement for their present high level cipher machine
(Typex)’. (30a)‘Almost one year has gone by since our last
conference with the British on cryptographic equipment for use in Combined
Communications. At that conference the principal subject was the possible
improvement of the CCM to increase its cryptographic security’. (30b)‘The Army
Security Agency has carefully studied the Navy proposal for modifying the CCM
and finds the following objections thereto: a. Although the proposed changes
would increase the cryptographic security of the machine, this increase would
not be of sufficient degree to justify their adoption in view of the practical
difficulties that would be encountered: ….’ (30b)‘As the
CCM machines now stand,we knowthat mechanically and electrically they
are satisfactory and stand up well in operation; cryptographically weknowwhere we stand, as a result of several years study of the present arrangements.
But we have not had any lengthy period to study the new proposals for motion
and reversed stepping; it is impossible to forecast what unforeseen
cryptographic weaknesses might be uncovered by further intensive study’. (30b)‘The ASA
believes that while at this moment the incorporation of either the Navy's or
the Army's proposed changes in the CCM appear to offer the possibility of
currently improving the CCM cryptographically, this improvement does not even
now appear to be quite sufficient to eliminate all questions as to what the
security of the so-improved CCM might be say five years from now. We know now
that a theoretical solution of CCM messages would still be possible and we also
agree that granting that there 'were a sufficient desire to make what is
theoretically possible a practical reality, by use of many people and analytic
machines, daily solution of CCM keys could be achieved. Thus, nothing
substantial or of long-term benefit would be gained by modification of the CCM
along the lines of the Navy's or the Army's proposals, which involve mere
changes in rotor motion,with or withoutreversed stepping’. (30b)‘In view
of the fact that the Army finds the Navy proposal for CCM modification
impractical and that the Army is convinced that any proposals which would
involve material physical changes in the CCM which cannot be made in the field
are impractical and inadvisable, the Army believes that as an interim measure
additional security in Combined Communications can more readily, more
economically and more practically be achieved by more frequent changes in
rotors’.(30b)1949–‘a. It is not in the best
Interest of the US to agree to the full and complete interchange of
cryptographic principles with the British. b. The release of the ECM under
prevent circumstances is not warranted’, ‘Although the CCM, if properly
used, is a highly secure machine, the experts of both nations agree that the
cryptographic principles employed in the machine are not as secure as is
considered desirable for highest level United States - United Kingdom communications’(30c)‘The
British state that the (World War II version of the basic ECM) was disclosed to
them in 1942. A limited number of Britishers have seen it. They do not however,
have enough information to build a duplicate of our ECM. The British probably
could construct a machine resembling our ECM’(30d).1950- ‘The US, as a matter of policy,
should not disclose to any foreign country the complete details of the ECM,
even though technical considerations might favor the use of the ECM for
combined communications’‘As
regards the effects on our own communication security, of the disclosure to the
British of the detailed information referred to above, there probably would be
no change in the security evaluation of the ECM. Although the US has always
emphasized the importance of the physical security of our cipher machines, our
evaluation of the ECM is predicated on possible ultimate enemy possession of
the ECM machine, and our security is based upon regularly changing the rotors
and key lists. The privacy of U.S. communications against cryptanalytic attack
by any foreign power, including the British, could be assured’ (30e).Development
of KL-7 and KL-47 cipher machines to replace the CCM (31).Modification
of CCM to HERMES standard (32).Possible
compromise of the MCB and the SIGROD by the Soviet Union (33).1951- Selection of CCM to serve as the
NATO Second level communications cipher (Naval, Army and Air Force Commands,
down to Divisional H.Q. plus NATO war vessels) in June 1951 (34).1952- The number of CCM immediately
available to NATO are 943 machines (35). Modification of CCM to HERMES
standard. Issuing of 20 rotors per machine and use of rotatable cam contours. Change
of the rotor stepping mechanism. Changes made effective for NATO on 1 October
1952. (36)1955- Approximately 1.875 CCM machines
have been distributed to NATO countries. NATO evaluation of the CCM is the
following: ‘Both versions of the CCM have been in use for many years and
require considerable expenditure for maintenance and spare parts. In addition,
the security provided is largely dependent on operating procedures rather than
on a strong cryptoprinciple’. Replacement of the CCM by theKL-7 ADONISis authorized in June 1955 (37). Starting in 1955 the CCM is
retired from US service (38).1956– NATO CCM to be replaced on 1 July
1956 by KL-7. A small number continued to be used for meteorological traffic
and as a reserve (39).1959- The State Department retires the
MCB worldwide in July 1959 (40).1962– NATO military committee orders the
disposal of CCM equipment and associated materials (41): ‘As a result of
exhaustive studies by the Standing Group Meteorological and
Communications-Electronics Committees, it has been determined that the CCM
equipment must now be regarded as totally unsuitable for the encryption of
meteorological traffic. In fact, the CCM equipment is in such bad condition due
to age, past usage, long term storage, lack of spare parts, and lack of
adequately trained maintenance personnel, that it is of no further use’.Sources:(a).Operating instructions for ECM Mark 2

Medicine Packaging Recycling Programs - Boots Blister Pack Recycling is Headed to Over 800 Stores (TrendHunter.com),"{'id': None, 'name': 'Trendhunter.com'}",https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/blister-pack-recycling,"16SIMILARPHOTOSBoots Blister Pack Recycling is Headed to Over 800 StoresMichael Hemsworth— February 14, 2025 —EcoReferences:boots.scan2recycle&naturalproductsonlineShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestThe Boots blister pack recycling program is headed to more than 800 of the retailer's locations to provide consumers with a way to recycle medicine and supplement packaging with greater ease. The initiative follows on the success of a pilot program that was trialled by the brand in London and the Southeast, and will also provide incentives to encourage consumers to participate. This includes offering Boots Advantage Card members with 100 points for every five blister packs recycled.Head of ESG Candice Smith spoke on the Boots blister pack recycling program saying, ""Taking medicines or vitamins in blister pack packaging is an essential part of everyday life for many of us – even more so during the winter when it is peak cough cold season.  We know from our pilot scheme that people want a recycling solution for their empty blister packs, which is why we’re now making it available in towns and cities across the country. We look forward to seeing the recycled materials take on a new life as playground equipment and furniture.""Trend Themes1. Consumer-driven Recycling Programs -Businesses are recognizing the demand for easy and accessible recycling solutions that engage consumers directly, leading to more sustainable product life cycles.2. Incentivized Sustainability Initiatives -Offering rewards or incentives for environmentally friendly actions encourages consumer participation in sustainability efforts, leading to increased recycling rates.3. Localization of Environmental Solutions -Expanding successful pilot programs to broader geographic areas increases access to recycling and supports eco-friendly consumer habits at a community level.Industry Implications1. Pharmaceutical Packaging -The pharmaceutical industry is innovating to create more sustainable packaging solutions as consumer demand for environmentally friendly options grows.2. Retail Recycling Infrastructure -Retailers are developing in-store recycling facilities to accommodate consumer disposal of packaging waste, fostering a sustainable shopping experience.3. Sustainable Consumer Goods -As environmental awareness rises, there's increased pressure and opportunity for consumer goods industries to incorporate more recyclable materials into their product offerings.8.6ScorePopularityActivityFreshnessVIEW MORE STATSexpand_moreGET A CUSTOM REPORTSUBSCRIBE TO ADVISORY"
The Collapse of Net Zero: Profiting from the Implosion of the Green Bubble,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Activistpost.com'}",https://www.activistpost.com/net-zero-banking-alliance-a-new-financial-era/,"February 17, 2025The Collapse of Net Zero: Profiting from the Implosion of the Green BubbleEditorEconomyInternational Man,Nick GiambrunoThe United Nations launched the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) with great fanfare in 2021.It brought together some of the world’s largest banks, committing them to a goal they could never achieve: reaching net-zero carbon emissions within their lending and investment portfolios.This entailed severing ties with a significant portion of their clients and investments in hydrocarbons, transportation, and other major industries while redirecting vast sums of shareholder funds into uneconomic “green” scams.In short, the NZBA represented a further politicization and weaponization of the global banking system. Companies or countries unwilling to bow to the climate cult faced the threat of being de-banked.Over the following months, more than 120 global banks—including HSBC, Bank of America, Barclays, and Deutsche Bank—tripped over themselves as they rushed to join the NZBA and earn ESG points.As the momentum for the NZBA continued to grow, the participating banks were put on a collision course for a reality check of historical proportions.As the big banks began to realize their NZBA pledges were an unrealistic fantasy, tensions started to build. These tensions finally erupted during a conference call between major banks and government regulators last year.During the call, Judson Berkey from UBS voiced his frustration and addressed the elephant in the room, stating that the “world’s biggest banks can’t live up to the green regulatory ideal unless they start shedding vast numbers of clients worldwide at a reckless pace, which would also disrupt economies across large regions of the globe that depend heavily on dirty fuels.”If the big banks were to fulfill their NZBA commitments, they would need to stop serving major commodity companies, energy-intensive tech firms, and numerous others whose carbon accounting didn’t add up. This would also require the banks to significantly scale back their operations in countries like Poland, Indonesia, South Africa, and others that rely heavily on coal as a primary energy source.Faced with this unappealing reality, the banks began reconsidering their involvement in the NZBA.Then came Trump’s victory in the 2024 election, and the dam burst.Within weeks of Trump winning, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan (America’s largest bank), and other major financial institutions announced their departure from the NZBA.The virtue-signaling rats are fleeing the sinking NZBA ship as fast as possible.I bring up the story of the NZBA because it highlights a long overdue paradigm shift in the global energy markets: the $5 trillion green bubble has burst.As Mark Mills points out in a Manhattan Institute report, governments worldwide have spent over $5 trillion in the past two decades to subsidize wind, solar, and other so-called green initiatives. To put that in perspective, $5 trillion is roughly the GDP of Japan, the world’s third-largest economy.Despite this staggering financial support, hydrocarbons still supply 84% of the world’s energy—a mere 2% drop since governments began binge spending on green initiatives two decades ago.So-called renewables—more accurately, unreliables—have been a giant flop. They are not viable for baseload power, even with massive subsidies. Today, using wind and solar for mass power generation is an artificial political solution that would not have been chosen on a genuinely free market for energy.Remember this the next time a politician, media outlet, academic, or celebrity casually insists that an energy “transition” is inevitable and imminent as if it’s preordained from above.It’s not.They’re trying to manufacture your consent for a scam of almost unimaginable proportions.I believe Trump’s return to the White House marks the beginning of the end for the Green Scam.Trump has pledged to end electric vehicle subsidies. He is also openly pro-hydrocarbon and pro-nuclear energy.I believe there is little political appetite to keep funneling trillions of taxpayer dollars into uneconomic boondoggles that have caused monumental distortions in the energy market and skyrocketing consumer prices.The situation is ripe for lucrative speculations.Unreliables—i.e., renewables—will not replace hydrocarbons anytime soon and will certainly not bring about energy security, despite what many “serious” people believe.When it comes to reliable baseload power, most of humanity has only three choices:Hydrocarbons—coal, oil, and gasNuclear powerAbandon modern civilization for a pre-industrial standard of living.Aside from friendly aliens delivering a magical new energy technology, most places have no other alternatives.Stay Ahead of the Curve – Protect Your Wealth and FreedomThe world is changing rapidly, and the economic, political, and cultural shifts happening right now will have a profound impact on yourmoney, investments, and personal freedom.Are you prepared for what’s coming next?Inside our exclusive report, you’ll discover:The key trends shaping the future and how they will affect youThe biggest risks ahead and what they mean for your financial securityThetop three strategiesyou need right now to protect and grow your wealthThere will likely be unprecedented volatility of every kind in the months and years ahead.That’s precisely why we’ve put together this Free PDF Report.Click here to download it now."

"TrumpED 2025: School Choice Corporatization, Social Impact Finance, and the Dismantling of the Department of Education","{'id': None, 'name': 'Activistpost.com'}",https://www.activistpost.com/project-2025-understanding-trumps-education-agenda/,"February 16, 2025TrumpED 2025: School Choice Corporatization, Social Impact Finance, and the Dismantling of the Department of EducationEditorSolutionsJohn Klyczek,Unlimited HangoutIn alignment with Project 2025, Trump pledges to eliminate the Dpt. of Ed and replace it with “school choice.” Rather than end federal control of education, Project 2025 education policy threatens to expand both government and corporate control of schooling in order to streamline ed-technocracy for the 4IR.President Donald Trump haspublicly stated, “I know nothing about Project 2025,”and“I have nothing to do with Project 2025.  . . . I haven’t read it. I don’t want to read it purposely. I’m not going to read it.” Trump has alsoaverred, “I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they’re saying, and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.” Obviously, these statements are contradictory, for if Trump is truly oblivious to the machinations of Project 2025, then how can he honestly disavow its policies, especially if he didn’t actually read the official“Playbook,”Mandate for Leadership: Project 2025?While contemplating the answer to this question, consider that Project 2025 contributorRussell Voughtwas recorded with a hidden camera which caught him saying that Trump’s public distancing from Project 2025 is merely a feint intended to deflect and placate his opponents in media and politics. Meanwhile, at least29Project 2025 contributors, including Project 2025 DirectorPaul Dans, have served under Trump in official positions across various levels during his first presidential administration.Moving forward into Trump’s second term, many of hispicksfor high-level officials in his executive branch areProject 2025 contributors. These includeCabinetappointments, such as John Ratcliffe, who is the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and Russell Vought, who is the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Other appointments includeTom Homan, who is Trump’sBorder Czar, andBrendan Carr, who is the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. Altogether, this constellation of Project 2025 contributors orbiting Trump indicates that his administration will be adopting at least some of the Project 2025 directives, such as themass deportationoperationalready being carried outby Homan.Heritage Foundation,Project 2025: Mandate for LeadershipHeritage Foundation,Project 2025 “Playbook”Concerning education policy, Trump has nominatedLinda McMahonto serve as the Secretary of Education. While McMahon did not contribute to Project 2025, theHeritage Foundation, which oversaw the publication of Project 2025, has been funded byAmerica First Works Inc.whereMcMahonserves as a “Board Member” and a “Senior Advisor.” McMahon, like Trump’s previous Secretary of Education,Betsy DeVos, has led several non-profit corporations, such asAmerica First Works Inc.and theAmerica First Policy Institute, which advocate for public-private“school choice”partnerships that are also championed inProject 2025.In anticipation of her secretarial confirmation,McMahonhas already met with multiple members of Congress, including SenatorMike Lee(R-UT), SenatorDave McCormick(R-PA), and SenatorTommy Tuberville(R-AL), to get the ball rolling for corporatistschool choiceoverhauls that align with Project 2025. Given McMahon’s pedigree, her nomination as Secretary of Education signals that the Trump administration will be going forward withProject 2025plans for dismantling the Department of Education (ED) and expanding school choice corporatization.Linda McMahon,Official photo as SBA AdministratorFar from abolishing government control of schools, the Project 2025 plan to disband the ED would only restructure the bureaucracies involved in administering federal education entitlements. In the meantime, Project 2025’s school choice reforms, which include federal “Education Savings Accounts” (ESAs), will likely expand government control over private schools, including religious schools, and home schooling, while also publicly subsidizing ed-tech corporations. At the same time, Project 2025’s school choice tax credits are primed to expand the corporatization of education through public-private partnerships that leverage ed-tech to data-mine how “Pay for Success” (PFS) impact scholarships streamline student outcomes for the social credit economy of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).To be sure, as I have documented extensively in a litany ofarticlesand my book,School World Order: The Technocratic Globalization of Corporatized Education, “school choice” is nothing more than a euphemism for an array of public-private partnerships that corporatize government education by funneling tax subsidies into private schools, charter school companies, and ed-tech businesses. Rather than foster curricular freedom independent of federal control, Project 2025’s menu of “school choices” is primed to restrict options to government-regulated private schools, charter edu-companies, and ed-tech corporations, or corporate-managed PFS scholarships, which data-mine students’ learning analytics for social credit commodification in the digital economy of the 4IR. In fact, key architects of Project 2025 are entrenched in the State Policy Network (SPN): an old swamp of neo-conservative and beltway-libertarian think tanks that has long been bankrolled by Koch Brothers philanthropy to push public-private “school choice” corporatization and social impact finance, which are integral to the planned stakeholder economy of the 4IR.The Dpt. of Education Reorganization Act: Shuffling the Chalkboards on the TitanicMandate for Leadership: Project 2025recommends that the Trump administration dissolve the ED by passing a “Department of Education Reorganization Act.”Trumphimself has essentially concurred as he has pledged, “[o]ne other thing I’ll be doing very early in the administration is closing up the Department of Education in Washington D.C., and sending all education and education work and needs back to the states.” Keeping his promise, Trump is preparing to sign an executive order that “would shut down all functions of the department [of ED] that are not written explicitly into statute, or move certain functions to other departments,” according toNewsweek. In the meantime, theDepartment of Government Efficiencyhas cut nearly $1 billion worth of ED contracts and grants. Republican Congressmen have also introducedHR 369andHR 899, which are bills to “[a]bolish” or “eliminat[e]” the ED.Official Seal of the US Department of EducationWhile Trump may align with Project 2025’s plan to sunset the ED, whether he knows it or not, doing so by itself would not return “all education . . . back to the states.” Rather than terminate the government’s control of education, axing the ED by itself would only reshuffle the bureaucracies in charge of schools as the federal entitlements provided under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), the Higher Education Act (HEA), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) would still remain. Unless the Trump administration were to also pass bills to repeal the ESEA, the HEA, IDEA, and WIOA, the mandates for administering federal education entitlements would merely be shifted to other government departments. In fact, such a reallocation of federal education entitlements through a “reorganization” of government bureaucracies is precisely what is laid out inProject 2025.According to the Project 2025Playbook, the proposed “Department of Education Reorganization Act” would transfer the bulk of federal education entitlements to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) while transferring other entitlements to the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Commerce (DOC), and the Department of State (DOS).For examples:TheOffice of Post-Secondary Education, which administers HEA entitlements, would be transferred to HHS.TheOffice of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, which administers IDEA entitlements, would be transferred to HHS.TheOffice of Career, Technical, and Adult Education, which administers WIOA entitlements, would be transferred to the DOL.TheOffice for Civil Rights, which enforcesTitle IXof theESEA and HEA Amendments of 1972, would be transferred to the DOJ.TheInstitute of Education Sciences, which oversees the Regional Educational Laboratories provided under Title IV of the ESEA, would be transferred to the Census Bureau of the DOC.Programs that are“important to national security”would be transferred to the DOS.In these ways, Project 2025’s“Department of Education Reorganization Act”would actually expand, rather than diminish, government reaches into education as five different federal agencies, rather than a single department, would be permitted authority over school systems. Meanwhile, the ED “employees whose positions are determined to be essential to the mission would move with their constituent programs” to the newly appointed departments, so much of the bureaucratic personnel will remain the same.At the same time, by yoking education to HHS and the DOL, Project 2025’s restructuring of the ED would basically revert the federal bureaucracy into a system that hearkens back the days of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), which implemented centralized “Planning, Programming, and Budgeting Systems (PPBS)” as the precursor to the ED and HHS. Whereas the 1979“Department of Education Organization Act”broke up HEW and upgraded its Office of Education into the ED while upgrading its Offices of Health and Welfare into HHS, Project 2025’s“Department of Education Reorganization Act”would merely shift the Offices of the ED back to HHS and other departments, such as the DOL, which administers“Welfare-to-Work”grants. In brief, Project 2025’s disassembling of the ED would bundle together federal health and education bureaucracies under the same department of HHS, like they were bundled together under the same department of HEW, while other departments, such as the DOL, would administerschool-to-workalong withwelfare-to-workprograms.RAND Corporation, PPBS Flowchart –Source|Official Seal of the US Department of Health, Education, and WelfareIn sum, the Project 2025 plan to dismantle the ED is just another contrivance to refurbish the labyrinth of federal bureaucracies which has always systematically reducedschool learning outcomesto an aggregate ofmental healthandworkforcecompetenciesthat determine student placement in the “human capital”supply chainof America’splanned economy. By scattering federal education entitlements to HHS and the DOL,data-trackingof students’mental healthandcareer pathwaysoutcomes would be streamlined by HHS and the DOL respectively, thus magnifying themedicalizationandcorporatizationof government schooling. In this redistributed bureaucracy, HHS and the DOL would also track studenthealthandcareeroutcomes linked withPFSscholarshipssubsidized by theschool choicetax credits proposed inProject 2025.School Choice, Social Impact Investing, and Government Control of Private, Religious, and Home SchoolsThere should be no doubt that Trump will greenlight the school choice reforms laid out in Project 2025. From his prior appointment ofBetsy DeVosas Secretary of Education, to his current nominations ofLinda McMahonandPenny Schwinnfor Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Ed respectively, Trump has consistently staffed the ED with champions of school choice. Picking up where his first term left off, President Trump has proclaimed that “universal school choice,” which is advocated inProject 2025, will be a cornerstone of his“Agenda 47”policy platform. Making good on his promise, Trump has signed Executive Order 14191 (“Expanding Educational Freedom and Opportunity for Families”), which directs the Secretaries of Education and Labor to formulate “discretionary grant programs to expand education freedom” while directing the Secretary of HHS to formulate “block grants . . . to expand educational choice . . . , including private and faith-based options.”Donald and Melania Trump,Agenda 47Executive Order 14191:“Expanding Educational Freedom and Opportunity for Families”The universal school choice reforms of Agenda 47 and Project 2025 will crest on the wave of Republican-led school choice bills that were legislated throughout 2023, which was dubbed the“Year of Educational Choice”aftertwenty statesadded or expanded school choice subsidies. Three more states joined the trend during the following election year of 2024. Preparing for the federal legislative sessions of 2025, Republican Governors, such asTennessee Governor Bill LeeandTexas Governor Greg Abbott, paved the way for the passage of universal school choice bills by ousting 2024 Congressional candidates, whether incumbents or challengers, who would not pledge to go along with school choice reforms.Now, with a Trump victory and a Republican mandate, there is an open lane for theProject 2025expansion of school choice privatization through the deregulation of charter school corporations; the authorization of ESAs for dispersing ESEA Title I funds; and the subsidization of “Scholarship Granting Organizations” (SGOs) with federal tax credits provided under the“Educational Choice for Children Act” (ECCA).Taking the open lane, Trump has already gotten the Project 2025 ball rolling by convening aNational School Choice Week Roundtablewhere he hosted Republican governors, including Lee and Abbott’s Lieutenant Governor Daniel Patrick, advising them on how they can capitalize on the school choice grants pending from his newEO 14191.Tennessee Governor Bill Lee(left) and TexasGovernor Greg Abbott(right)While theProject 2025 Playbookcalls for “lessen[ing] the federal restrictions on charter schools,” the Playbook places a more ambitious emphasis on instituting ESAs and tax credits that funnel government subsidies not only into charter school companies, but also private schools, including religious schools, and home schools as well. To be sure, while both the ESA and tax-credit proposals of Project 2025 would siphon public tax dollars into private corporations, each entails different implications for expanding either the corporatization of public education or the federal regulation of private, religious, and homeschools. In particular, ESAs could expand the regulatory reaches of the federal government while the tax credits proposed by Project 2025 are primed to streamline “Pay for Success” (PFS)impact investmentsthat turn profits based on whether studenthealthandcareeroutcomes conform to benchmarks standardized byESGand othersocial creditindexes.Concerning the prospects of ESAs,Project 2025calls for a portion of each student’s ESEA Title I funding to be allocated for “education savings accounts . . . that parents can use to pay for personal tutors, education therapists, books and curricular materials, private school tuition, transportation and more.” Based on these stipulations, such ESA stipends could be used to subsidize not only “private school[s],” but alsoBig Techcorporations through the purchase ofed-tech productswhich are integral to the ubiquitousdata-miningand omnipresentAIthat are imperative in driving thesocial credit economyof the4IR. For examples:ESA funds for “curricular materials” could be used to buySkinnerianadaptive-learning courseware, such as Clever and Knewton, which have been financed byPeter Thiel, along withDreamboxand Brightspace LeaP, all of which data-mine students’ cognitive-behavioral psychometrics.On left: Dreambox Learning,“Adaptive Learning – What Is It?”| On Right: Peter Thiel –SourceESA dollars for “education therapies” could be used to pay for assistive biofeedback wearables, such asHeartMathEKG monitorsformanaging test anxietyandBrainCoEEG headbandsformanaging ADHD, both of which data-mine students’socio-emotional biometrics.On left: Inner Balance –Source|On right: Brain Technology, Implantables, and Neuroprosthetics –SourceESA money for “personal tutors” could be spent onGPTAI tutors, whichdata-minestudents’ cognitive-behavioral and socio-emotional algorithms.The tabletop tutor robot, Moxie –SourceAt the same time, ESA stipends for “private school tuition” could come withstrings attachedto federal regulations that subordinate private and home schools to government control. Consider the Alabama State“Creating Hope and Opportunity for Our Students’ Education (CHOOSE) Act,”which issues $7,000 ESAs for attending “an accredited private school, including church, parochial, or religious school” along with $2,000 ESAs for costs associated with attending “homeschool.” The CHOOSE Act stipulates that payouts from these ESAs are subject to the following provisions:“[P]articipating school[s]” that receive ESA dollars must “[a]gree to comply with all applicable health and safety laws or codes” and “require all participating students receiving program funds to take a standardized assessment.” Furthermore,  “participating school[s]” must “[p]rovide the department [of Revenue] with school-level test results for participating students.” Failure to comply “shall constitute grounds for the department, in its discretion, to suspend or disqualify the . . . participating school from receiving program funds.”“[P]arent[s],” including “homeschool” parents, who receive ESA funds must “[a]gree to comply with rules adopted by the department for the administration of the program” and “[s]ubmit to the department any information required by the department for implementation of the program.” Failure to comply “shall constitute grounds for the department, in its discretion, to revoke, recover, suspend, or deny the [ESA] credit otherwise made available pursuant to this act.”To be sure, similar restrictions could be imposed through federal ESAs asProject 2025indicates that the Alabama CHOOSE Act is one of theten state ESA lawson which its proposal for federal ESAs is based. As a result, such Title I ESAs would federalize private schooling as much as corporatize public education, simultaneously expanding the reaches of Big Government and maximizing the profits of Big Business.On the other end of Project 2025’s school choice platform, there is a proposal to pass the“Educational Choice for Children Act (ECCA),”which would award federal tax credits to corporations that donate to “Scholarship Granting Organizations” (SGOs) designated to dole out “scholarships” to students to cover the costs of “qualified elementary or secondary education expense[s].” According to the ECCA, such qualified expenses include “tutoring expenses” and “expenses at private or religious elementary and secondary education institutions.”Educational Choice for Children Act –SourceUnlike the CHOOSE Act, the ECCA stipulates that “[n]othing in this Act, or any amendment made by this Act, shall be construed to permit, allow, encourage, or authorize any Federal, State, or local government entity, or officer or employee thereof, to mandate, direct, or control any aspect of any private or religious elementary or secondary education institution.” However, the ECCA also stipulates that “[n]othing in this Act, or any amendment made by this Act, shall be construed to permit, allow, encourage, or authorize any Federal, State, or local government entity, or officer or employee thereof, to mandate, direct, or control any aspect of any scholarship granting organization.” In other words, while the ECCA prevents private and religious schools from being federally regulated as a result of accepting government-subsidized SGO scholarships, it does not prevent SGO corporations from controlling the terms and conditions, including PFS social impact provisions, of the scholarships.To be sure, “Pay for Success” impact contracts are provided for in theEvery Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which reauthorizes and amends the ESEA. In accordance with ESSA,“Pay for Success”contracts can stipulate that an SGO put corporate money upfront for scholarships and then receive that money back from the government, along with a potential profit, depending on whether student outcomes meet or exceed projected“social impacts”that align withESGand othersocial credit metrics. In fact, many SGOs facilitate their scholarships through social impact contracts.Social Credit Flowchart –SourceConsider theSagamore Institute, which is “an action-oriented think tank” that facilitates “social impact” investments through “sustainable initiatives,” such as its “Scholarships for Education Choice program.” Registered as a “Certified Participating SGO” under the Indiana State Department of Education’s“School Scholarship Tax Credit Program,”theSagamore Institutegrants “Education Choice” scholarships in “partner[ship] with large and small schools, traditional and classical schools, secular and faith-based schools, and schools that serve special needs populations.” The Sagamore Institute has alsopushed“Impact Investing” aimed at “‘Supply Side’ Welfare Reform” that redistributes “Private Capital for [the] Public Good” of remedying socioeconomic disparities across racial demographics.The Sagamore Institute –SourceSimilarly, thePoint Foundation, which is “the nation’s largest scholarship-granting organization for LGBTQ students,” doles out “impact” scholarshipsaimedat “mitigat[ing] generations of racism and an education system born from discriminatory policies by providing financial support, community resources, and professional development to LGBTQ students who identify as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color [BIPOC].” Point Foundation scholarships, which aresponsoredby World Economic Forum (WEF)partners, such as Amazon and Morgan Stanley, are bankrolled bydonationsstipulated for “advanc[ing] social justice, diversity, inclusion, and equality” along with “equity.” In other words, the Point Foundation’s impact scholarships are issued to advance social justice outcomes for LGBTQ-BIPOC stakeholders in accordance with theESGsocial credit economychampioned by theWEF.Point Foundation: The LGBTQ Scholarship Fund –SourceIf you think that such “DEI” impact scholarships have now been banned due to Trump’s recentexecutive orders (EOs), think again. EO 14151 (“Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing”)and EO 14173 (“Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity”) only repeal DEI provisions stipulated in prior executive orders, including EO 11246, EO 11478, EO 12898, EO 13583, EO 13672, and EO 13985. Although EO 14190 (“Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling”) expunges “Federal funding sources and streams, including grants or contracts, that directly or indirectly support or subsidize the instruction, advancement, or promotion of gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology,” it does so only “to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.” Since none of Trump’s executive orders repeal diversity, equity, inclusion, or PFS provisions codified in theESSAlaw, none of his EOs prohibit ESSA PFS contracts that subsidize SGO impact scholarships which target DEI or ESG outcomes; nor do any of his EOs prohibit federal tax credits from subsidizing corporate donations to such SGOs.To be sure, PFS impact investments are pushed not only by “left-wing”DEI organizations, but also by “right-wing” conservative think tanks, such as theAmerican Enterprise Institute(AEI) whereMax Eden, who is aco-authorof Project 2025’s “Department of Education” chapter, has served as a Research Fellow, a Senior Fellow, and an Education Policy Program Manager. In fact, in a “Research Paper” drafted for a 2014 AEI Research Conference titledSchool Choice: Encouraging New and Better Schools, Eden advocates for “social impact bonds” financed by “private school choice venture capital firms.”On left: American Enterprise Institute (AEl) –Source|On right: Max Eden –SourceAlthough the AEI does not endorse impact investments that target sociocultural DEI outcomes, the AEI does call for PFS investments that targetsocioeconomic outcomes, includingworkforce,health, andsafetyoutcomes.

For over 30 years,Koch-SPN partners, including theHeritageFoundation, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), theCato Institute, theAEI, andEdChoice, have been advocating school choice subsidies for private schools anded-techcompaniesthat provide thedigital infrastructurefordata-miningPFS impacts on students’learning algorithmsandsocial credit analytics. In fact, a survey of the authors andAdvisory Boardof Project 2025 reveals that the school choice ESAs and tax credits proposed inMandate for Leadershipwere put forward by affiliates of these Koch-SPN partners many of which have also beenadvancingPFSand otherimpact investmentschemes.TheProject 2025 Advisory Boardincludes the Heritage Foundation andALEC, the latter of which is a consortium of lawyers, legislators, lobbyists, and other “stakeholders” who draft boilerplate bills that are adopted by lawmakers to advance privatization schemes. For examples:ALEC has drafted the “Education Savings Account Act,” which codifies generic provisions for “ESA” subsidies that allocate government payments for “private school[s],” “charter school[s],” and “non-public online learning program[s],” including “[p]ayment for purchase of curriculum [and] any supplemental materials,” such as ed-tech courseware.Education Savings Account Act – SourceALEC has also drafted the “Student-Centered Funding Act,” which offers guidelines for issuing government “voucher[s]” and “tax-credit scholarship[s]” for “private school[s]” and “charter schools” through “a student-centered finance model based on a weighted student formula in which money ‘follows’ a child to his or her school” by “tying funding to performance.”The Student-Centered Funding Act –SourceALEC has also spearheaded online school choice privatization by propagating the“Virtual Public Schools Act,”which has been used to legalize the public funding of virtual-online charter school corporations in alignment with the “10 Elements of High-Quality Digital Learning” standardized by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush’s Digital Learning Council.Virtual Public Schools Act –SourceThroughout Trump’s first presidential term, a roster of ALEC associates filled at least19of his White House and Cabinet appointments, including his Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, who staffed her ED withveteransof Bush’s Foundation for Excellence in Education (ExcelinEd). AtALEC headquarters, DeVos pledged her secretarial commitment to “get the federal government out of the way” so that ALEC could further its progress in legislating corporate school choice reforms, including “ESA,” “voucher,” and “Tax Credit Scholarship” reforms. Prior to her appointment as Secretary of Ed, DeVosbankrolledand/orchairednumerous school choice nonprofits, including EdChoice, the Alliance for School Choice, and theAmerican Federation for Children, which sponsored severalALEC Annual Meetings, including the2011Annual Meeting where Bush’s“Elements of High-Quality Digital Learning”were adopted by ALEC’s “Education Task Force.”On left: Betsy DeVos –Source| On right: Jeb Bush –SourceUnder Secretary DeVos,Robert S. Eitel and Jim Blew, who are bothco-authorsof Project 2025’s“Department of Education”chapter, served as “Senior Counselor” and “Assistant Secretary of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development” respectively. Eitel also served as the“national director”of the Alliance for School Choice where DeVos has served aschair. A longtimefinancial supporterof theHeritage Foundation, DeVos hasannouncedthat “the second Trump term agenda is very, very consistent with what we started. It’s a continuation of the first term.” In fact, DeVos advised that, during his second term, President Trump “needs to . . . get the federal tax credit passed and to de-power the Department of Education” in accordance with Project 2025’s school choice reforms.On left: Robert S. Eitel –Source|On right: Jim Blew –SourceDeVos is not the only Secretary of Education to team up with ALEC to push technocratic school choice corporatization. Indeed, ALEC bestowed itsThomas Jefferson Awardto Secretary of EducationWilliam Bennett, who took over the mantle ofProject BEST(Basic Education Skills through Technology), which launched public-private partnerships between government schools and Big Tech corporations that laid the groundwork for ed-tech data-mining in the social credit economy of the4IR. ALEC’s“Education Task Force”has included representatives from virtual-online charter school corporations, such as K12 Inc., which was set up byBennettand financed byDeVos.It is worth noting here that K12 Inc. was also bankrolled by billionaire technocratLarry Ellison, whom Trump recentlytappedto deployOracle, aCIA-linkedartificial intelligencecorporation thatcollaborateswith theWEF, for theStargateAI infrastructureproject. It is also worth noting that Trump’s “shadow president,”Peter Thiel, was a private consultant toSecretary DeVosand a speechwriter forSecretary Bennett.On left: William Bennett –Source| On right: Oracle’s Larry Ellison –SourceLike DeVos, Bennett is a longtime ally of not only ALEC, but also theHeritage Foundation, which is the “arch-conservative”think tankthat has driven Republican policies, includingProject 2025, for more than ahalf century. In particular, Bennett has served as aDistinguished Fellow in Cultural Policy Studiesat the Heritage Foundation whereLindsey M. Burke, who is the main author of Project 2025’s“Department of Education”chapter, is the Director of the Center for Education Policy.

It is worth noting here that the roster of Koch-backedSPN partnersincludes theAmerica First Policy Institute, where Linda McMahon serves as the “Chair of the Board.”On left: Erin Valdez –Source| On right: Andrew Gillen –SourceIt is also worth noting here that many of these Koch-SPN cronies have advocated PFS and other impact investment ploys. For examples:In a report titled “Pay-for-Outcomes: Transforming Federal Social Programs to Expand Individual Well-Being,” theHeritage Foundationweighed the cost-benefit pros and cons of “pay-for-success” contracts and “[s]ocial impact bonds (SIBs)” in favor of “pay-for-outcomes” financing that “combine[s] the best features of these [PFS and SIB] reforms.”In a whitepaper titled “Pursuing Innovation: How Can Educational Choice Transform K12 Education in the US?,”EdChoicecalled for “new social financial models that have emerged from partnerships between the public, non-profit, and private sectors. These include social impact bonds, innovation funds, and impact investing” along with “pay-for-success (PFS) contracts.”At the 2015ExcelinEd National Summit, a “Strategy Session” discussing “school choice and Pay for Success” innovations was moderated byChester Finn Jr., who was Bennett’s Assistant Secretary of Education. This Strategy Session convened a panel that includedKevin Chavous, who has served as a president of Bennett’sK12 Inc.; an Executive Team member of Bush’s Digital Learning Council; a board member of DeVos’s American Federation for Children; and an advisor to Barack Obama’s re-election campaign.TheCharles Koch Foundationhas collaborated with Google andSocial Finance, which is a premier social impact investment corporation, inpartnershipwith Per Scholas, to advance “diversity, equity, and inclusion” through “Zero Percent Loans” for “career pathways” training that fosters “sustainable tech talent pipeline[s]” for the “tech workforce.”“Investing for ‘Impact’ or Investing for Profit? Social Impact Bonds, Pay for Success, and the Next Wave of Privatization of Social Services and Education,” –SourceIn sum, the Koch-SPN network encirclingProject 2025reveals that theMandate for Leadership’sschool choice reforms are nothing more than a renewal of a longtime stratagem to corporatize government education through ESAs and tax credits which subsidize the ed-tech infrastructure needed to data-mine students’ social credit analytics. Indeed, the history of the Koch-SPN syndicate behind Project 2025 illustrates thatpublic-private school choice partnershipshave always been geared for streamlining the digital ecosystem necessary to reduce student learning to human capital, which can be monetized and socially engineered through impact finance in the stakeholder economy of the 4IR.Pick Your PoisonDon’t get swept away in the disruptive whirlwind of Trumpian overhauls or the surrounding hype about how Trump is “winning” and the “Deep State” is “losing.” To be sure, it might seem like dismantling the ED, in conjunction with school choice reforms, will end federal government control of education. Yet the Project 2025 gameplan for dissolving the ED will only restructure bureaucratic control of education while ESAs will likely expand federal control of schools as ESAs conventionally come with government strings attached. At the same time, federal tax credits for SGO scholarships are primed to be leveraged through PFS impact contracts, which come with corporate strings attached to social credit outcomes.In the final equation, the terms and conditions of Project 2025’s school choice options will not be chosen by students, parents, or even schools, but will instead be chosen by Big Government, Big Business, and Big Tech stakeholders. Even the generic menu of charter schools and ed-tech vendors, which comprise much of the consolation choices afforded to students and parents, were prechosen by Koch-SPN corporatists long before the popularity of Trump or affiliated MAGA branding.

AI Energy Drain Among Issues Facing ESG Investors,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Ai-cio.com'}",https://www.ai-cio.com/news/ai-energy-drain-among-issues-facing-esg-investors/,"Home>News>Research>AI Energy Drain Among Issues Facing ESG InvestorsResearchFebruary 28, 2025AI Energy Drain Among Issues Facing ESG InvestorsData center energy needs, human rights and plastic pollution are among trends for investors to watch, according to ISS ESG.ByMichael KatzKeeping up with the massive energy needs of data centers to support a surge in artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies is among the main issues facing investors in environmental, social and governance assets, according to areportfrom Institutional Shareholder Services’ ISS ESG.Human rights due diligence and potential international treaties regarding plastics pollution were also cited as trends investors should keep an eye on in 2025 in the report from ISS ESG, which, like CIO, is owned by ISS STOXX.Citing the International Energy Agency, the report stated that data center electricity consumption could more than double to more than 1,000 terawatt hours in 2026 from 460 TWh in 2022, adding that this would account for 3% of the world’s electricity usage, up from 1.7%.“AI as a technology may lead to greater energy efficiency and smarter allocation of computing workloads to minimize the carbon impact, but the aggregate energy use of companies with large data center operations is clearly growing,” the report stated.For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.The report noted that some technology companies are looking to satisfy their increasing energy needs using low-carbon energy sources such as nuclear power. However, it added that “taken together, the rise in data center electricity demand and focus on lower-carbon energy sources offers mixed signals as to whether large technology companies are transitioning in a manner consistent with Net Zero ambitions.”Beyond energy issues, the report found that protection of human rights appears to be shifting from a voluntary commitment to a mandatory one: “With significant regulations already in place and more planned, many companies worldwide either already face or soon will face enforceable corporate due diligence duties related to human rights impacts along their global value chains.”As an example, the report cited the European Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, which came into effect in July 2024 and is intended to address the need to standardize the European Union’s legal framework. The directive establishes a “corporate due diligence duty” covering human rights and environmental impacts, the report noted.Concerns about “persistent” plastic pollution are also likely to be a major focus for ESG investors during 2025, according to the report. ISS cited an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development report that found global plastic waste is expected to nearly triple by 2060, with approximately half ending up in landfills and only 20% expected to be recycled.“The United Nations Plastics Treaty negotiations, which will continue into 2025, are seeking to address plastics pollution at the international level,” the report stated. “Possible treaty provisions on harmful chemicals in plastics may also have future legal implications for companies. Depending on its final form, the UN Plastics Treaty could increase the risks to companies and investors from plastic pollution.”Related Stories:The Impact of Impact Investing: SDGs and ESGHouse Republicans Characterize ESG as an Anti-Trust CartelISS ESG Unveils Climate Reporting Requirement DatasetTags:AI,Artificial Intelligence,Cryptocurrency,data center,environmental,ESG,Governance,human rights,Institutional Shareholder Services,ISS ESG,plastics pollution,social«Florida SBA Files Complaint Against Target for LGBT Pride CampaignMost PopularIs the Shine Coming Off of Private Credit’s ‘Golden Age’?With Interest Rates Elevated, It’s Time for Fixed IncomeWeathering the Storm: Investment Solutions for Climate ResilienceIndependent Schools Increasingly Using Outsourced CIO ProvidersHow Big Is OCIO Market?

This impressive year saw the launch of The Atollia by Centara Hotels & Resorts, the multi-island destination in the Maldives. The first of two resorts – the underwater world-themed Centara Mirage Lagoon Maldives – opened its doors in November 2024, and will be joined in April 2025 by Centara Grand Lagoon Maldives, a sophisticated five-star retreat. This will expand Centara’s portfolio in the Maldives to four resorts under four distinct brands and concepts: Centara, Centara Mirage, Centara Grand, and The Centara Collection.Centara’s brand strategy has evolved significantly in recent years, with the debut of the luxury Centara Reserve brand, and the reimagining of the vibrant lifestyle-focused Centara Life. In January 2025, Centara unveiled The Centara Collection, a curated compilation of one-of-a-kind, high-end hotels and resorts, which celebrate individuality, locality and authenticity. The portfolio comprises hotels such as Machchafushi Island Resort & Spa Maldives and Roukh Kiri Khao Yai, amongst others, and will continue to grow in 2025.Stunning beachfront view of Centara Grand Mirage Beach Resort Pattaya — Photo by CentaraTwo of the group’s flagship resorts in Thailand – Centara Grand Mirage Beach Resort Pattaya and Centara Karon Resort Phuket – completed comprehensive renovations in 2024 and are already delighting guests with their all-new and upgraded facilities and services. And now, Centara will transform two more of its most popular Thailand resorts. Centara Grand Beach Resort & Villas Hua Hin, the world-renowned heritage resort, will undertake a phased and extensive renovation which will preserve and celebrate the historical and colonial charm of the property, whilst significantly upgrading all accommodations, public spaces and facilities. The refurbishment programme will also see the creation of a new collection of 70 exclusive villas, which will fall under The Centara Collection. In addition, an entirely separate, neighbouring 200-room Centara Life hotel will raise Centara’s beachfront inventory in Hua Hin town to just under 500 keys, offering three distinct brands and experiences. Centara Grand Beach Resort & Villas Krabi, which is nestled in a private cove overlooking the Andaman Sea, will also close for a major transformation this year. Upon completion, it will be relaunched as Centara Reserve Krabi, marking only the second location worldwide for this luxurious, experiential storytelling brand concept.Complementing these landmark renovations and rebrandings, Centara intends to open nine new hotels and resorts this year. Following the highly-anticipated debut of the 142-key Centara Grand Lagoon Maldives in April 2025, the group will launch four more international properties this year: the new Annapurna Mountain Resort, and Centara Collection resort in Bali, which will mark Centara’s arrival in Nepal and Indonesia respectively, plus two new hotels in Vietnam – Centara Hotel & Residences Van Don, and Crystal Holidays Harbour Van Don, which will feature a combined total of 977 keys.Centara will also reaffirm its leadership position in Thailand, where it currently operates 51 hotels and resorts. Centara Life Wisma Hotel Ratchaburi will open at the end of March whilst three additional hotels are set to start welcoming guests later this year: Centara Villas Phi Phi Island, Saree Samui (part of The Centara Collection), and Centara Life Hotel Surat Thani.These openings and renovations will be instrumental in helping Centara to increase its average room rate and revenue per available room (RevPAR). In 2025, Centara expects that the revenue (including JV hotels) growth of 23% YoY.Unforgettable family fun awaits at Centara Mirage Lagoon Maldives — Photo by CentaraA series of new signature experiences will now be rolled out across the Centara and Centara Grand brands, as the group continues to elevate every aspect of the guest journey. And to further enhance its end-to-end user experience, a new guest-centric app will be launched in the first half of 2025, making it simpler for guests to make reservations, and driving greater personalisation. An AI chatbot will further streamline the process by enabling direct bookings through social chat platforms, and social media will play a key role in connecting with new-gen audiences.Every aspect of Centara’s development and operations is underpinned by the company’s commitment to sustainability. The group is working towards several important environmental targets, including a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, a 20% decrease in water usage by 2029, and overall net zero emissions by 2050. Further progress was made in 2024, as eight more properties introduced solar panels to generate their own renewable energy, and the number of Centara’s hotels and resorts certified by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) increased to 93%. Centara also became the first hotel group in Thailand to achieve GSTC certification. These continued efforts, coupled with the company’s focus on being an equal opportunities employer, with a strong emphasis on diversity and inclusion, affirm the company’s dedication to responsible business practices, and this was further recognised when Centara was named as an“Industry Mover”in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook, and received a“AAA”rating in the SET ESG Ratings 2024.2024 was an outstanding year for Centara, as our business rebounded strongly with a 43% rise in net profit and the debut of several exciting new projects, most notably The Atollia by Centara Hotels & Resorts in the Maldives. We have carried this positive momentum into 2025 and are well on track towards achieving our target of becoming a top 100 global group and boosting revenue to THB 20 billion by 2027. We look forward to inspiring and delivering more memorable moments for our guests throughout 2025, and introducing exciting new and reimagined resorts and destinations.Michael Henssler, Chief Operating Officer of Centara Hotels & ResortsTo learn more about Centara Hotels & Resorts, please visitwww.centarahotelsresorts.com.About Centara Hotels & ResortsCentara Hotels & Resorts is Thailand's leading hotel operator.

Opinions expressed are those of the author.| Membership (fee-based)Mar 07, 2025, 07:15am ESTSave ArticleSanjay Annadate, VP and Business Head EMEA,LatentView Analytics.gettyWhen ChatGPT, the popular GenAI chatbot from OpenAI, was launched, it reached a whopping100 million monthly active usersjust two months after its debut, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history. The technology has now surpassed the stage of being a buzzword and is viewed as a transformational technology that has impacted every sector worldwide. Areportfrom IBM shows that three-quarters of CEOs (75%) believe competitive advantage depends on generative AI.When people think about using GenAI in business, they often picture snazzy marketing campaigns or hyperpersonalized customer experiences.Gartnersays customer service and marketing are its primary business functions. However, healthcare is another area with widespread usage of GenAI in personalized medical care, drug development and discovery and disease diagnosis.While these applications grab headlines, there is a whole world of action happening behind the scenes, which is just as impressive. These applications might not be as glamorous as a viral marketing campaign, but they are essential for operational efficiency and cost savings.Supply ChainIn recent years, global supply chains have witnessed a drastic transformation due to challenges of various capacities. It started with the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to global trade disruptions and geopolitical tensions that exposed vulnerabilities in the global supply chain, causing delays, shortages and increased costs. With GenAI now entering the picture, new opportunities are emerging to address these challenges and optimize supply chain operations.Areport by EYsays that around 40% of supply chain organizations are investing in GenAI. Considering it can accelerate the development of complex applications, interfaces andsupply chain solutions by 30%,significantly enhancing overall agility, this may be a sound investment. Additionally, in demand forecasting, which forms an important component for supply chain agility, can be improved as GenAI identifies patterns and trends from a large amount of data by analyzing historical sales data, market conditions and factors such as weather or economic indicators.Another area where the technology is utilized issupplier compliance. For example, verifying supplier compliance with ESG standards in the automotive industry is crucial but often challenging, especially for smaller suppliers. Large OEMs need more manual checks to ensure adherence. GenAI offers a solution that automates the compliance verification process. It can quickly assess compliance, summarize findings and highlight discrepancies by analyzing supplier checklists. This approach saves time and improves accuracy in monitoring ESG adherence throughout the supply chain.SalesMcKinsey suggeststhat one-fifth of sales teams’ tasks can be automated or mademore efficient. The primary focus of sales is to build long-term relationships that extend beyond transactions while delivering genuine value to customers. However, this is often accompanied by a significant amount of administrative and routine tasks. AI tools that address these challenges couldopen up incremental trillionsin productivity across sales and marketing.GenAI can craft personalized outreach messages and proposals, predict customer behavior and provide insights into market trends. GenAI-powered chatbots can engage website visitors, qualify leads by asking questions and pass on the best prospects to sales representatives. These bots can also handle routine queries, freeing up human agents for higher-value interactions.Another promising use case is automating briefing documents for client meetings. Traditionally, preparing these documents took two to three days of intensive work. With the new approach, inputting all relevant research into a large language model (LLM) allows it to summarize the content and generate a polished presentation in minutes.HRHR has been at the heart of every organization, and its functions are deeply rooted in manual processes. GenAI helps HR professionals focus more on strategic decisions that shape company culture and employee success and not get bogged down by repetitive tasks. The globalgenerative AI in HRmarket size is expected to be worth around $2,803.04 million by 2034. GenAI-powered tools can automate tasks like resume screening, interview scheduling and candidate matching, significantly reducing the time and effort required for talent acquisition.A Talent Acquisition Specialist from BCG mentioned in arecent postthat although the integration of GenAI in talent acquisition is still in its early stages in the organization, it’s already starting to transform workflows. It has notably reduced time spent on repetitive administrative tasks, such as managing candidate lists, allowing more time for strategic activities.While software can enhance efficiency and streamline many HR processes, it should always be a tool rather than a replacement for human insight. The right mix of maturity, complemented by a balanced human and AI strategy, could boost HR productivityby up to 30%. The real challenge lies in finding the right balance between using GenAI’s capabilities and maintaining the critical elements of fairness, ethics and human touch.Way ForwardOrganizations really need to think beyond the obvious cases and explore the full range of possibilities GenAI offers to drive innovation and efficiency across business operations.A Strategic Approach To Utilizing GenAI For Your Organization• Evaluate holistically the needs of the organization:Organizations have to conduct a comprehensive assessment of their workflows to identify where GenAI can make the most impact. It is essential to map out both short-term and long-term needs and gains to ensure the technology aligns with evolving business strategy.• Figure out the top challenges of the organization and if GenAI can aid in solving them:It is important to identify specific areas where GenAI can address challenges. By understanding the organization’s pain points, businesses can apply AI solutions in a way that brings measurable improvements.• Follow a strategy-led implementation of GenAI:Products and solutions should not be created just to include GenAI. It should be a layer on top that improves an organization’s core business proposition. Every business is unique and has specific needs, and organizations have to understand how it can act as a copilot to aid its strategic objectives.The real power of GenAI lies not just in its ability to innovate at the surface level but in its capacity to streamline and enhance the essential functions that keep a business running smoothly.Forbes Business Development Councilis an invitation-only community for sales and biz dev executives.Do I qualify?Follow me onLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"

Though we rank highly on theHuman Development Index, the countrylags behind in leadership gender equality.Women make up 50.8% of the population and hold 40.8% of parliamentary leadership roles. But they hold only 28.5% of board seats and 26.4% of executive roles in the New Zealand’s Stock Exchange (NZX) top 50 companies (the NZX50).And while businesses are encouraged to disclose gender diversity policies by the NZX, there are no mandatory quotas, leaving progress uneven.However, change is happening. Our newresearchlooked at the the percentage of female directors in NZX-listed firms between 2016 and 2022.What we found is positive. Using information from financial infrastructure and data provider LSEG’sdatabase on global financial markets, we identified a rise in the number of female directors on corporate boards. We also saw a corresponding improvement in the firms’ ESG performance.Despite making up 50.4% of the population, women hold only 28.5% of board seats and 26.4% of executive roles in NZX50 companies.T. Schneider/ShutterstockBoosting performanceBetween 2016 and 2022, the proportion of female directors in NZX-listed firms increased from 26% to 36%. These same businesses saw an average 33% improvement in their ESG performance.Notably, governance – one of the key ESG pillars – improved significantly, with a 31% increase on average. Governance specifically refers to the effectiveness of the firm’s management systems, board structure and capacity to protect shareholder interests.While it’s not possible to say outright that having more women on the board directly influenced governance outcomes, we saw a positive relationship between the two. This suggests having more women in leadership strengthens corporate oversight and ethical decision making.Gender diversity does not have the same level of importance in all contexts. While social and environmental performance also improved, this study found no significant link between a more gender-diverse board and these higher scores in social and environmental performance.Our findings aresupported by overseas researchsuggesting board diversity does not strongly influence sustainability outcomes when it comes to issues and groups already covered by legislation.Therefore, New Zealand’s proactive stance on issues such as the environment, poverty and human rights, as well as encouraging private companies to improve sustainability and transparency, may explain why board diversity had no notable impact on social and environmental performance in this study.What women bring to the businessOur findings align with studies completed overseas.In the US,one studyfound women business leaders tended to prioritise transparency, fairness and stakeholder interests. This made them strong advocates for sustainable and inclusive business practices.It’s clear that addressing the gender gap in corporate New Zealand isn’t just about fairness. It’s about economic success. Businesses that embrace diversity perform better, attract top talent and enhance their reputations.The solution isn’t simply about enforcing quotas, but ensuring more qualified women are placed in leadership roles. Companies need to move beyond a “compliance mindset” and recognise true diversity strengthens governance, reduces risk and drives long-term success.As the world celebratesInternational Women’s Day on March 8, businesses need to realise that increasing female representation at the top isn’t just the right thing to do – it’s the smart thing to do.FeminismEquityDiversityStockmarketEnvironmental, Social and GovernanceCorporate boardsESGDEINew research, Australia New ZealandBusiness + Economy"
Three Keys To Designing An Impactful Marketing Campaign,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Forbes'}",https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbescommunicationscouncil/2025/03/07/three-keys-to-designing-an-impactful-marketing-campaign/,"LeadershipThree Keys To Designing An Impactful Marketing CampaignByKaren Quinn, Forbes Councils Member.forForbes Communications CouncilCOUNCIL POSTExpertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author.| Membership (fee-based)Mar 07, 2025, 07:00am ESTSave ArticleKaren Quinn, Senior Director, Brand and Corporate Communications,Finastra.gettyEvery marketing professional knows that authenticity is one of the most important attributes of a successful campaign—and one of the hardest to achieve. When it comes to brand building, authenticity drives resonance and connection with your customers.At my company, we recently launched our latest global brand campaign, “Finance is Open,” which is an extension of our purpose of how open finance can “unlock the potential of people, businesses and communities, everywhere.” The objective of this campaign was to explain and amplify the benefits of open finance in three ways: for social impact, sustainability and growth and collaboration.Here are three ways we executed a measurable, authentic marketing campaign that delivered on our goals.1. Balance continuity with evolution.Seven years ago, my company launched with a vision that “The Future of Finance is Open.” It not only represented our commitment to open finance but also addressed overlooked systemic issues within the financial services space by working to engage with underbanked populations around the world. This vision has served as a catalyst for the products we create and the partnerships we form. Today, we recognize that the industry at large has evolved. So, when it was time to launch our new campaign, we updated that foundational language to “Finance is Open.”All this to say, when launching marketing campaigns, it’s important to ask: Is this an evolution of our company’s core values? How can we connect this back to our existing brand to demonstrate that we’re evolving alongside our industry? Staying true to your North Star can help your organization adapt messaging to reflect the new challenges customers face while remaining aligned with your overall vision and purpose.2. Identify and articulate measurable outcomes that align with customer values.According toMcKinsey researchers, “Increasingly, consumers also expect their favorite brands to create value beyond product benefits.” With this in mind, we built our corporate brand story around three outcomes that resonate with customers and illustrate these outcomes in the context of their financial institutions and organizations. Throughout our global “Finance is Open” campaign, we connected those outcomes to the solutions we build and the markets we serve, which is a critical way to connect the work any brand does to the real-world benefits it delivers.An example within our campaign was explaining how open finance can help institutions make more sustainable decisions. We brought it to life by connecting it to the problems facing institutions (transitioning to a low-carbon economy, growing demand for “green” products, pursuing complex ESG agendas and the many other competing challenges that they contend with) and emphasizing how it can help banks leverage ecosystem data for insight related to sustainability, risk or scenario planning.Demonstrating interconnectedness and accountability helps reaffirm that initial value-add. When your audience sees that the work your organization is doing aligns with the values that matter to them and relates to the problems they face, it strengthens their connection with your brand.3. Empower stakeholders to amplify key messages.Employees can be a brand’s most enthusiastic and authentic messengers, and social media allows them to share content organically with their communities. According to the2024 LinkedIn report, “It always pays to stand out,”80% of buyers use social media in their professional lives, and 41% expected to grow their use of social media between March 2024 and March 2025. There’s no denying that this is a powerful tool and that employees can play a crucial role in expanding the reach of marketing campaigns.As marketers, it’s our responsibility to include voices across different genders, races and ethnicities in the creation and storytelling process, as well as to identify a diverse bench of spokespeople to communicate on behalf of our organizations, like Microsoft and IBM, to be a part of the story and share their perspectives. Prioritizing diverse stories can help strengthen a message, reinforce the “why” behind a brand’s story and illustrate how a message and mission are relevant to people from all walks of life.Last but not least, an incentive program can help drive engagement with employees and their communities. At my company, we use a social-sharing platform, where employees can subscribe to receive content ranging from broad topics about our industry to information relevant to their specific business units. We also reward employees for amplifying content: Each month, the five advocates with the highest engagement scores receive a swag bag to thank them for sharing and engaging with our content.An authentic, impactful marketing campaign delivers measurable results and helps customers connect with your brand. Balancing continuity with evolution, connecting outcomes to customer values and empowering employees to tell your brand story are three ways to create a campaign that delivers on these goals.Forbes Communications Councilis an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies.Do I qualify?Follow me onLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video"
"World Must Prepare to Fight Climate Change Without US, UK Says","{'id': None, 'name': 'Insurance Journal'}",https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/03/07/814635.htm,"World Must Prepare to Fight Climate Change Without US, UK SaysByAntony Sguazzin|March 7, 2025Email ThisSubscribe to NewsletterArticle2 CommentsThe world needs to prepare to fight global warming without the help of the US as the Trump administration pulls billions of dollars pledged to initiatives funding the green transition, the UK’s climate envoy said.This week, South Africa said the US notified it about withdrawing from a coal-transition pact to which it had committed $1 billion. In January, Washington canceled $4 billion of pledges to the Green Climate Fund, the largest of its kind globally. The fate of billions of dollars pledged by the US to green shifts in Indonesia and Vietnam is unclear.“You plan for the worst and hope for the best,” Rachel Kyte, the envoy, said in an interview in South Africa’s capital of Pretoria on Thursday. “We have to plan for a world where the US is not transfusing funds into the green transition.”Since taking office on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump has disrupted the aid and development-finance worlds by dismantling organizations and initiatives, canceling funding and railing against efforts to combat climate change. While that’s thrown those sectors into disarray, leaders from outside the US said they will continue with their programs.“The science didn’t change on Jan. 20,” Kyte said, before opening the launch of the findings of a UK-funded study into the health impacts of living near coal-fired power plants. “Even though we see US entities green hushing or mollifying their commitments to ESG, the investment patterns outside the US remain the same,” she said referring to environmental, social and governance issues.Kyte’s comments come as climate initiatives also deal with the slashing of aid and development budgets by rich European nations — including the UK — that are diverting money to defense after Trump indicated he would water down US security commitments to the bloc.A shift in focus is necessary, Kyte said.Climate-finance initiatives will need to attract more money from private investors, multilateral development banks will need reform to play a larger role and a myriad initiatives must be “de-fragmented” to build larger pools of capital, she said.“There has been an uptick in calls for reform to make the multilateral development-bank system, the international financial architecture, more fit for purpose,” she said. “Bigger, bolder, better. Bigger is the question mark as we see how the US shows up in the international arena, but better and bolder is still on the table.”Kyte also cautioned that the impact of the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement international climate treaty and climate-finance initiatives should not be overestimated. While the world’s largest economy has pledged billions of dollars to climate initiatives, it has delivered a lot less, she said.“We have over many years now lived and managed our multilateral climate funds and multilateral development banks, the whole international architecture, on the basis of US pledges that have been unrealized because Congress has been on balance opposed to this kind of expenditure,” she said. We have to “hope that it comes back one day with more than pledges.”Photograph: Electricity pylons near the Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd.

The implementation of strict ESG disclosure requirements, carbon pricing mechanisms, and sustainability mandates by governments is driving businesses towards greener choices. Renewable energy, particularly solar, wind, and green hydrogen, is growing quickly, while carbon capture and storage (CCS) and circular economy initiatives are gaining momentum. AI and data analytics are transforming carbon tracking, ESG reporting, and climate risk modeling. Sustainable finance, which includes green bonds and ESG-focused investments, is expanding, enhancing funding for low-carbon innovations. With tightening regulatory frameworks and increasing investor demand for sustainability, companies are incorporating climate strategies into their core operations, driving market growth. There is also a rise in collaboration among governments, corporations, and financial institutions to establish standardized sustainability frameworks and encourage large-scale adoption of green technologies.Request Sample Pages@https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=224421448By technology, cloud computing to hold the largest market share in 2025, driven by rising use of cloud platforms in scalable ESG reporting and real-time carbon trackingCloud computing is the largest technology segment in the green technology &sustainability industry in 2025, providing real-time data processing for ESG reporting, carbon tracking, and energy optimization. Businesses can now gather sustainability data in a centralized and automated manner, while also complying with evolving regulations such as the CSRD and SEC climate disclosure rules. The integration of cloud-based AI and machine learning enables better predictions on climate risk reduction, emissions reduction prediction, and renewable energy forecasting through predictive analytics. Furthermore, major cloud providers are investing in carbon-neutral data centers and energy-efficient infrastructure, supporting sustainability goals while helping enterprises transition to low-carbon digital operations. For businesses that prioritize sustainability, cloud computing is essential for efficient integration, analysis and reporting of data in the field. For companies looking to increase the scale of their sustainability initiatives without spending large amounts of money on onsite infrastructure, it is often the most flexible and cost-effective option.Strict emissions regulations, fleet electrification, and AI-driven supply chain optimization will push transportation & logistics as the fastest growing end user segment over the forecast periodThe transportation & logistics end-user segment in the green tech and sustainability market is experiencing rapid growth due to increasing emissions regulations, supply chain decarbonization mandates, and the widespread use of electric and alternative fuel vehicles. Carbon-reducing policies are being enforced by governments globally. Fleet electrification, hydrogen-powered trucks, and biofuels are gaining traction as companies seek to reduce Scope 1 and 3 emissions. Initiatives such as the US Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and EU Fit for 55 are designed to encourage sustainable transportation practices and promote the adoption of environmentally friendly strategies by logistics firms. The implementation of AI-led route optimization and smart logistics platforms is resulting in higher fuel efficiency and lower operational carbon footprints. Additionally, the shipping and aviation sectors are adopting environmentally friendly alternatives to ship engines and aircraft carriers to meet more stringent international emissions standards. Carbon accounting software and blockchain-based tracking solutions are becoming more prevalent in the supply chain sector due to increasing demand for environmentally friendly options from both consumers and investors.Inquire Before Buying@https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=224421448Asia Pacificis set to become the fastest growing regional market, fueled by massive renewable energy investments, EV expansion, and rising corporate sustainability commitmentsRapid industrialization, strong government policies, and substantial investment in renewable energy are set to make theAsia Pacificregion the fastest growing region in the green technology & sustainability.China,IndiaandJapanall have strict regulations on environmental issues;Chinahas announced its double carbon goals: a 20% peaking of emissions by 2030 with 80% for carbon neutral by 2060, andIndiahas recently embarked upon 'Promoting widespread adoption of green technologies' through its Renewable Energy Mission.
